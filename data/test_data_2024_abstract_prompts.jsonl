In parallel, weight entanglement has emerged as a technique for intricate parameter sharing among architectures within macro-level search spaces. Since weight-entanglement poses compatibility challenges for gradient-based NAS methods, these  two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods (enhanced performance, improved supernet training properties and superior any-time performance), while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces.

Inferring these multimodal functions from experimental data is a central task in modern protein engineering. Global epistasis models are an effective and physically-grounded class of models for estimating fitness functions from observed data. These models assume that a sparse latent function is transformed by a monotonic nonlinearity to emit measurable fitness. Here we demonstrate that minimizing contrastive loss functions, such as the Bradley-Terry loss, is a simple and flexible technique for extracting the sparse latent function implied by global epistasis. We argue by way of a fitness-epistasis uncertainty principle that the nonlinearities in global epistasis models can produce observed fitness functions that do not admit sparse representations, and thus may be inefficient to learn from observations when using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (a common practice). We show that contrastive losses are able to accurately estimate a ranking function from limited data even in regimes where MSE is ineffective. We validate the practical utility of this insight by showing contrastive loss functions result in consistently improved performance on benchmark tasks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Continuously updating the source model over long horizons can result in significant drift in the source model, forgetting the source domain knowledge. Moreover, most of the existing approaches for lifelong TTA require adapting all the parameters, which can incur significant computational cost and memory consumption, limiting their applicability on edge devices for faster inference. We present FEATHER (liFelong tEst-time Adaptation wiTH lightwEight adapteRs), a novel lightweight approach that introduces only a small number of additional parameters to a pre-trained source model which can be unsupervisedly and efficiently adapted during test-time for the new test distribution(s), keeping the rest of the source model frozen. FEATHER disentangles the source domain knowledge from the target domain knowledge, making it robust against error accumulation over time. Another distinguishing aspect of FEATHER is that, unlike some recent approaches for lifelong TTA that require access to the source data for warm-starting the adaptation at test time, FEATHER does not have such a requirement. FEATHER is also orthogonal to the existing lifelong TTA approaches and can be augmented with these approaches, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of additional parameters needed to handle the lifelong TTA setting. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, ImageNetC, and ImageNet3DCC Robustbench benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that, with substantially (85% to 94%) fewer trainable parameters, FEATHER achieves better/similar performance compared to existing SOTA lifelong TTA methods, resulting in faster adaptation and inference at test-time. The source code for FEATHER will be released upon publication.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Within the same framework of cosine-similarity-based representation learning, margins have played a significant role in enhancing face and speaker recognition tasks. Interestingly, despite the shared reliance on the same similarity metrics and objective functions, contrastive learning has not actively adopted margins. Furthermore, decision-boundary-based explanations are the only ones that have been used to explain the effect of margins in contrastive learning. In this work, we propose a new perspective to understand the role of margins based on gradient analysis. Based on the new perspective, we analyze how margins affect gradients of contrastive learning and separate the effect into more elemental levels. We separately analyze each and provide possible directions for improving contrastive learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that emphasizing positive samples and scaling gradients depending on positive sample angles and logits are the keys to improving the generalization performance of contrastive learning in both seen and unseen datasets, and other factors can only marginally improve performance.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In this paper, we propose a novel conditional adversarial support alignment (CASA) whose aim is to minimize the conditional symmetric support divergence between the source's and target domain's feature representation distributions, aiming at a more discriminative representation for the classification task. We also introduce a novel theoretical target risk bound, which justifies the merits of aligning the supports of conditional feature distributions compared to the existing marginal support alignment approach in the UDA settings. We then provide a complete training process for learning in which the objective optimization functions are precisely based on the proposed target risk bound.

However, the continual learning aspect of these aligned LLMs has been largely overlooked. Existing continual learning benchmarks lack sufficient challenge for leading aligned LLMs, owing to both their simplicity and the models' potential exposure during instruction tuning.\nIn this paper, we introduce TRACE, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate continual learning in LLMs. TRACE consists of 8 distinct datasets spanning challenging tasks including domain-specific tasks, multilingual capabilities, code generation, and mathematical reasoning.  All datasets are standardized into a unified format, allowing for effortless automatic evaluation of LLMs.\nOur experiments show that after training on TRACE, aligned LLMs exhibit significant declines in both general ability and instruction-following capabilities. For example, the accuracy of llama2-chat 13B on gsm8k dataset declined precipitously from 28.8\\% to 2\\% after training on our datasets. This highlights the challenge of finding a suitable tradeoff between achieving performance on specific tasks while preserving the original prowess of LLMs. Empirical analysis reveals that training on reasoning tasks effectively mitigates the loss of general abilities of LLMs. Motivated by this, we introduce the Reasoning-augmented Continual Learning (RCL) approach. RCL integrates task-specific cues with meta-rationales, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting in LLMs while expediting convergence on novel tasks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Most existing methods heavily rely on the label smoothness assumption to correct noisy labels, which adversely affects their performance on heterophilous graphs. Further, they generally perform poorly in high noise-rate scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical model based framework PRGNN. Given a noisy label set and a clean label set, our goal is to maximize the likelihood of labels in the clean set. We first present PRGNN-v1, which generates clean labels based on graphs only in the Bayesian network. To further leverage the information of clean labels in the noisy label set, we put forward PRGNN-v2, which incorporates the noisy label set into the Bayesian network to generate clean labels. The generative process can then be used to predict labels for unlabeled nodes. We conduct extensive experiments to show the robustness of PRGNN on varying noise types and rates, and also on graphs with different heterophilies. In particular, we show that PRGNN can lead to inspiring performance in high noise-rate situations.

Several crucial points remain unclear. First, it is still hard to understand why we need the uncertainty modeling. One might directly apply the encoder-decoder models equipped with the corresponding losses to handle the noisy labels. To be specific, what happens if we only use Q and P_\\\\varphi without the prior distribution, and conduct the training without the prior-related losses? The second question is related. From the experiments in Figure 3, the weighted cross-entropy loss wL_CE(P_\\\\varphi, Y_N) is much more important than others. So, it seems it is much more important to balance the loss between reconstruction of clean labels and that of noisy labels, other than the probabilistic modelling particularly given the label space (which is the random variable we focus on) is of small dimension. Third, the authors claim that the proposed probabilistic graphical model is able to avoid the issue of label smoothness in existing methods. However, it seems this is attributed to the application of prototype label vectors, instead of simple concatenation of labels with node embeddings for message passing. This is also observed in Figure 3. Overall, to make the proposed models effective, the authors introduce various techniques. However, it appears that the one which demonstrates consistent success is not aligned with the contributions claimed by the authors. \\n\\n2. About the introduction of the baselines, it is unknown which one applies label smoothness, and which one is proposed for Heterophilous graphs.\\n\\n3. It seems this paper is only applicable for the transductive setting not inductive setting. \\n\\n4. The last question is on the general research domain for learning from noisy graphs. While it is true that many data we process in practice definitely contain different kinds of noise, the proposed methods are always evaluated in the scenarios where we add artificial perturbation to the clean data. My point is we actually need some real tasks and perhaps some fixed benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different methods, such that we can clearly justify how the progress is made and how the challenges are addressed.\", \"Questions\": \"See the weaknesses above.\"}"}]}

While many methods address these two issues separately, only a few currently deal with both simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce Utility-based Perturbed Gradient Descent (UPGD) as a novel approach for the continual learning of representations. UPGD combines gradient updates with perturbations, where it applies smaller modifications to more useful units, protecting them from forgetting, and larger modifications to less useful units, rejuvenating their plasticity. We use a challenging streaming learning setup where continual learning problems have hundreds of non-stationarities and unknown task boundaries. We show that many existing methods suffer from at least one of the issues, predominantly manifested by their decreasing accuracy over tasks. On the other hand, UPGD continues to improve performance and surpasses or is competitive with all methods in all problems. Finally, in extended reinforcement learning experiments with PPO, we show that while Adam exhibits a performance drop after initial learning, UPGD avoids it by addressing both continual learning issues.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The authors claim that by adding the perturbation we are making the unimportant weights more plastic however I am not really convinced by this explanation I believe it requires elaboration both in the rebuttal and in the paper. \\n\\nAnother related issue with the proposed perturbation is the fact that all of them are getting drawn from the same standard normal distribution. This design choice is strange to me since the parameters of a neural network usually differ in magnitude from layer to layer. By adding an unscaled random perturbation to all of the weights we are ignoring this scale difference which I believe is sub-optimal. I know that in the unprotected version, they are getting weighted by different values but this particular scaling is more correlating with changes in the loss value rather than the parameter magnitudes.\\n\\nHighly relevant to the above issue, I believe it is also necessary to have an additional ablation study, investigating the role of having and not having the perturbations in the update rule. I also want to disentangle the effect of weight decay. The only time that UG is added in the ablation is in the presence of WD. More specifically I am curious about the following scenarios in Figure 8: \\n\\n* Added ablations:\\n    + SGD + UG + WP + WD (present in the paper)\\n    + SGD + UG + WP \\n    + SGD + UG + WD\\n    + SGD + UG\\n\\n    \\n**Including more diverse experiments:** Moreover, in the experiments section I believe the authors need to include more diverse experiments. All of the streaming tasks are permutations of the same task. Whether in the label or in the input space. It is not as obvious as the authors' claim that after the permutation of the input space the previously learned representations are not relevant anymore (end of page 6). In the input-permuted scenario, only the first layer needs to have significant change. This is especially true for the label-permuted tasks as the network does a good job of clustering the data up to the final FC layer. I encourage the authors to use the Cifar100 superclass dataset (or any similar sequence of tasks that does not simply rely on the permutation).\\n\\n**Visualization:** Finally, I believe the visualization needs several improvements: the legends on the plot are very hard to read (Fig 2, 3, 4, 5). Some colors are similar to each other and the width of the lines in the legends is too thin. (Especially in figure 4). In Figure 7, some numbers in dark blue cells are almost impossible to read.\", \"Questions\": \"**Q1:** Have the authors tried to use an scaled version of the perturbation that takes the magnitude of the parameters into account? (Other than the unprotected version). Also I would appreciate the if you could elaborate on the effect of perturbations.\\n\\n**Q2:** Could you also explain about the average online accuracy? it is stated that \\\"The average online accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions within each task.\\\" I cannot see the average part here. Is it calculating the accuracy on each task separately then averaging over the number of tasks?\"}"}]}

Specifically, we show empirically that popular models are vulnerable to adversarial permutation in answer sets for multiple-choice prompting, which is surprising as models should ideally be as invariant to prompt permutation as humans are. These vulnerabilities persist across various model sizes, and exist in very recent language and vision-language models.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In response to these challenges, various quantization techniques have emerged as highly effective solutions. However, quantization methods using conventional data types, including integer or floating-point, face certain limitations in balancing between accuracy drop and computational benefit. In light of the advent of hardware accelerator design for AI processing, quantization research has entered a new phase: custom data types and specialized hardware have emerged as innovative alternatives. Particularly, piecewise quantization and block floating-point quantization exhibit notable performance and efficiency improvements, but they still suffer from handling outliers with huge dynamic ranges. To solve this issue, we introduce Super Floating-Point (SuFP), a breakthrough data type and quantization method that improves both memory footprint and logic efficiency without compromising model accuracy. The key idea of SuFP is multi-region piecewise quantization using a tensor-wise scalable bias. It can configure an optimized precision for each region to capture both dense near-zero data and outliers. In addition, the scalable bias offers flexible adaptability to diverse data distributions, requiring only a single addition operation at the tensor level. Furthermore, the tailored hardware for SuFP employs only integer arithmetic units and shifters, facilitating a highly compact hardware realization. Our experimental results show that SuFP quantization achieved accuracy performance on par with, and in some cases even exceeded, that of full precision floating-point (FP32) across vision, language, and generative model benchmarks. Its computational capability and energy efficiency have been dramatically improved by 9.00$\\times$ and 17.04$\\times$ over FP32 implementations, surpassing state-of-the-art MSFP and BSFP, up to 7.20$\\times$ and up to 2.06$\\times$, respectively.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However,  the true gradient of the objective function can be difficult to access in certain scenarios, which normally can be approximated by zeroth-order (ZO) methods. SZOHT algorithm is the only algorithm tackling $\\ell_0$ sparsity constraints with zeroth-order gradients so far. Unfortunately,  SZOHT  has a notable limitation on the number of random directions due to the inherent conflict between the deviation of ZO gradients and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator. \nThis paper approaches this problem by considering the role of variance and provides a new insight into variance reduction: mitigating the unique conflicts between ZO gradients and hard-thresholding.  Under this perspective, we propose a generalized variance reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm as well as the generalized convergence analysis under standard assumptions. The theoretical results demonstrate the new algorithm eliminates the restrictions on the number of random directions, leading to improved convergence rates and broader applicability compared with SZOHT.  Finally, we illustrate the utility of our method on a portfolio optimization problem as well as black-box adversarial attacks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

While offline RL with linear function approximation has been extensively studied with optimal results achieved under certain assumptions, many works shift their interest to offline RL with non-linear function approximation.\nHowever, limited works on offline RL with non-linear function approximation have instance-dependent regret guarantees.\n    In this paper, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm, dubbed Pessimistic Nonlinear Least-Square Value Iteration (PNLSVI), for offline RL with non-linear function approximation. Our algorithmic design comprises three innovative components: (1) a variance-based weighted regression scheme that can be applied to a wide range of function classes, (2) a subroutine for variance estimation, and (3) a planning phase that utilizes a pessimistic value iteration approach. Our algorithm enjoys a regret bound that has a tight dependency on the function class complexity and achieves minimax optimal instance-dependent regret when specialized to linear function approximation. Our work extends the previous instance-dependent results within simpler function classes, such as linear and differentiable function to a more general framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first statistically optimal algorithm for nonlinear offline RL.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

As a result, LLMs will frequently interact with us and other agents. It is, therefore, of great societal value to understand how LLMs behave in interactive social settings. We propose to use behavioral game theory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behavior. We let different LLMs play finitely repeated games with each other and with other, human-like strategies. Our results show that LLMs generally perform well in such tasks and also uncover persistent behavioral signatures. In a large set of two-player, two-strategy games, we find that LLMs are particularly good at games where valuing their own self-interest pays off, like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave sub-optimally in games that require coordination, like the Battle of the Sexes. We, therefore, further focus on two games from these distinct families. In the canonical iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we find that GPT-4 acts particularly unforgivingly, always defecting after another agent has defected only once. In the Battle of the Sexes, we find that GPT-4 cannot match the behavior of the simple convention to alternate between options. We verify that these behavioral signatures are stable across robustness checks. Finally, we show how GPT-4's behavior can be modified by providing further information about the other player as well as by asking it to predict the other player's actions before making a choice. These results enrich our understanding of LLM's social behavior and pave the way for a behavioral game theory for machines.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Actually the results in your coordination game study suggest one: first predict the opponent's next action, and then play a best response against that.

Does it mean the maximum payoff of the current player in the game matrix?

For example, the maximum deviation you can gain assuming your opponent's strategy is fixed.\\n\\n     ii Also, I am not sure how is the scores against different types opponents are aggregated into one score for each entry of Table 1. Is it an average over the scores against all opponents? If it is, then probably it also need justification.\\n\\n    iii For the results in the prisoner's dilliemma section.

Which one is the more intelligent one according to this result? Also is the right-hand figure of Figure 3 depict only one trajectory? How many trajectories do you run for each pair of strategies?\\n\\n    iv.

The primary objective of structure learning is to learn a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that represents the underlying probability distribution of the data. Many prominent DAG learners rely on least square losses or log-likelihood losses for optimization. It is well-known from regression models that least square losses are heavily influenced by the scale of the variables. Recently it has been demonstrated that the scale of data also affects performance of structure learning algorithms, though with a strong focus on linear 2-node systems and simulated data. Moving beyond these results, we provide conditions under which square-based losses are minimal for wrong DAGs in $d$-dimensional cases. Furthermore, we also show that scale can impair performance of structure learners if relations among variables are non-linear for both square based and log-likelihood based losses. We confirm our theoretical findings through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Or, why is optimizing the score function equivalent to optimizing MMSE?\\n3.\\tIn practical applications, most of the score functions we choose are not affected by data normalization, just like the SRL function mentioned in this article.

The recent progress in large-scale generative models has further expanded their use in real-world language applications. However, the critical challenge of improving the generalizability and factuality of LLMs in natural language understanding and question answering remains under-explored. While previous in-context learning research has focused on enhancing models to adhere to users' specific instructions and quality expectations, and to avoid undesired outputs, little to no work has explored the use of task-specific fine-tuned Language Models (SLMs) to improve LLMs' in-context learning during the inference stage. Our primary contribution is the establishment of a simple yet effective framework that enhances the reliability of LLMs as it: 1) generalizes out-of-distribution data, 2) elucidates how LLMs benefit from discriminative models, and 3) minimizes hallucinations in generative tasks. Using our proposed plug-in method, enhanced versions of Llama 2 and ChatGPT surpass their original versions regarding generalizability and factuality. We offer a comprehensive suite of resources, including 16 curated datasets, prompts, model checkpoints, and LLM outputs across 9 distinct tasks.

To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task.

However, such a competition game falls short when insights about data distributions beyond their authenticity are imperative, such as in multi-modal generation and image super resolution. In recognition of the limitations inherent to the pure-competitive mechanism, we introduce CCGAN, a Collaborative-Competitive Generative Adversarial Network scheme to enable data generation with additional knowledge beyond the provided dataset distribution. For theoretically preserving the equilibrium point and numerically avoiding training collapse issue, we show the need to convert regularization term into a divergence, so that the modified GAN is well-defined in game theory. By harmonizing the competition and collaboration losses in CCGAN, we effectively reduce the degree complexity of solving the optima, facilitating the establishment of a closed-form equilibrium point. This equilibrium point serves as a guidance for training and hyper-parameter tuning, resulting in consistently high-quality generated samples. Meanwhile, the regularization breaks the mutual dependency between the generator and discriminator. This newfound independence empowers the CCGAN to explore a broader parameter space, effectively mitigating the training collapse issue. To validate the capabilities of CCGAN, we design comprehensive experiments across four publicly available datasets and systematically compare CCGAN against a range of baseline models. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CCGAN on generating satisfactory samples tailored to specific requirements, particularly when applied to the generation of images featuring regularly shaped objects.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Conversely, parallel computation is beneficial for executing operations that are mutually-independent and can be executed simultaneously and not necessarily sequentially (e.g. when counting individual colors for the query: \u201cdetermine the maximally occuring color amongst all t-shirts\u201d). Accordingly, in this work, we introduce a novel fully neural iterative and parallel reasoning mechanism (IPRM) that combines the benefits of iterative computation with the ability to perform distinct operations simultaneously. Our experiments on various visual question answering and reasoning benchmarks indicate that IPRM exhibits stronger reasoning capabilities and generalization than existing recurrent as well as transformer-based reasoning and vision-language interaction mechanisms while requiring lesser parameters and computation steps. Notably, IPRM achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the challenging CLEVR-Humans dataset and outperforms prior task-specific methods for the NLVR and CLEVR-CoGen benchmarks.

Recent works have shown that leveraging data-driven solutions that utilize advances in deep learning methods to learn from past data of an epidemic often outperforms traditional mechanistic models. However, in many cases, the past data is sparse and may not sufficiently capture the underlying dynamics. While there exists a large amount of data from past epidemics, leveraging prior knowledge from time-series data of other diseases is a non-trivial challenge.\n\nMotivated by the success of pre-trained models in language and vision tasks, we tackle the problem of pre-training epidemic time-series models to learn from multiple datasets from different diseases and epidemics. We introduce Pre-trained Epidemic Time-Series Models (PEMS) that learn from diverse time-series datasets of a variety of diseases by formulating pre-training as a set of self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. We tackle various important challenges specific to pre-training for epidemic time-series such as dealing with heterogeneous dynamics and efficiently capturing useful patterns from multiple epidemic datasets by carefully designing the SSL tasks to learn important priors about the epidemic dynamics that can be leveraged for fine-tuning to multiple downstream tasks. The resultant PEM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in various downstream time-series tasks across datasets of varying seasonal patterns, geography, and mechanism of contagion including the novel Covid-19 pandemic unseen in pre-trained data with better efficiency using smaller fraction of datasets\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing approaches have apparently improved robust accuracy, but, in fact, these performance gains mainly come from trade-offs at the expense of average accuracy. To control the trade-off flexibly and efficiently, we first propose a simple class-specific scaling strategy, directly applicable to existing debiasing algorithms without additional training. We also develop an instance-wise adaptive scaling technique to overcome the trade-off and improve the performance even further in terms of both accuracies. Our approach reveals that a na\\\"ive ERM baseline matches or even outperforms the recent debiasing methods by only adopting the class-specific scaling technique. Then, we employ this technique to evaluate the performance of existing algorithms in a comprehensive manner by introducing a novel unified metric that summarizes the trade-off between the two accuracies as a scalar value. By considering the inherent trade-off and providing a performance landscape, our approach delivers meaningful insights into existing robust methods beyond the robust accuracy only.

We focus on disentangled representation learning for home appliance electricity usage, enabling users to understand and optimize their consumption for a reduced carbon footprint. Our approach frames the problem as disentangling each attribute's role in total consumption. Unlike existing methods assuming attribute independence which leads to non-identiability, we acknowledge real-world time series attribute correlations, learned up to a smooth bijection using contrastive learning and a single autoencoder. To address this, we propose a Disentanglement under Independence-Of-Support via Contrastive Learning (DIOSC), facilitating representation generalization across diverse correlated scenarios. Our method utilizes innovative \\textit{l}-variational inference layers with self-attention, effectively addressing temporal dependencies across bottom-up and top-down networks. We find that DIOSC can enhance the task of representation of time series electricity consumption. We introduce TDS (Time Disentangling Score) to gauge disentanglement quality.

Despite strong successes in supervised domains, such methods have not yet been extended to reinforcement learning, where the lack of a fixed dataset renders most distillation methods unusable.\nFilling the gap, we formalize $\\textit{behaviour distillation}$, a setting that aims to discover and then condense the information required for training an expert policy into a synthetic dataset of state-action pairs, $\\textit{without access to expert data}$. \nWe then introduce Hallucinating Datasets with Evolution Strategies (HaDES), a method for behaviour distillation that can discover datasets of $\\textit{just four}$ state-action pairs which, under supervised learning, train agents to competitive performance levels in continuous control tasks.\nWe show that these datasets generalize out of distribution to training policies with a wide range of architectures and hyperparameters. We also demonstrate application to a downstream task, namely training multi-task agents in a zero-shot fashion.\nBeyond behaviour distillation, HaDES provides significant improvements in neuroevolution for RL over previous approaches and achieves SoTA results on one standard supervised dataset distillation task. Finally, we show that visualizing the synthetic datasets can provide human-interpretable task insights.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The primary difficulty in this task is that the model's predictions may be inaccurate, and using these inaccurate predictions for model adaptation can lead to misleading results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach that considers multiple prediction hypotheses for each sample and investigates the rationale behind each hypothesis. By consolidating these hypothesis rationales, we identify the most likely correct hypotheses, which we then use as a pseudo-labeled set to support a semi-supervised learning procedure for model adaptation. To achieve the optimal performance, we propose a three-step adaptation process: model pre-adaptation, hypothesis consolidation, and semi-supervised learning.

This paper uncovers an issue with the existing RFT, \nwhere optimizing both adversarial and natural objectives through the feature extractor (FE) yields significantly divergent gradient directions. This divergence introduces instability in the optimization process, thereby hindering the attainment of adversarial robustness and rendering RFT highly sensitive to hyperparameters. To mitigate this issue, we propose a low-rank (LoRa) branch that disentangles RFT into two distinct components: optimizing natural objectives via the LoRa branch and adversarial objectives via the FE. Besides, we introduce heuristic strategies for automating the scheduling of the learning rate and the scalars of loss terms.

However, the training and inference of  GNNs on large graphs remain resource-intensive, impeding their utility in real-world scenarios and curtailing their applicability in deeper and more sophisticated GNN architectures. To address this issue, the Graph Lottery Ticket (GLT) hypothesis assumes that GNN with random initialization harbors a pair of core subgraph and sparse subnetwork, which can yield comparable performance and higher efficiency to that of the original dense network and complete graph. Despite that GLT offers a new paradigm for GNN training and inference, existing GLT algorithms heavily rely on trial-and-error pruning rate tuning and scheduling, and adhere to an irreversible pruning paradigm that lacks elasticity. Worse still, current methods suffer scalability issues when applied to deep GNNs, as they maintain the same topology structure across all layers. These challenges hinder the integration of GLT into deeper and larger-scale GNN contexts.  To bridge this critical gap, this paper introduces an $\\textbf{A}$daptive, $\\textbf{D}$ynamic, and $\\textbf{A}$utomated framework for identifying $\\textbf{G}$raph $\\textbf{L}$ottery $\\textbf{T}$ickets ($\\textbf{AdaGLT}$). Our proposed method derives its key advantages and addresses the above limitations through the following three aspects: 1) tailoring layer-adaptive sparse structures for various datasets and GNNs, thus endowing it with the capability to facilitate deeper GNNs; 2) integrating the pruning and training processes, thereby achieving a dynamic workflow encompassing both pruning and restoration; 3) automatically capturing graph lottery tickets across diverse sparsity levels, obviating the necessity for extensive pruning parameter tuning. More importantly, we rigorously provide theoretical proofs to guarantee $\\textbf{AdaGLT}$  to mitigate over-smoothing issues and obtain improved sparse structures in deep GNN scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{AdaGLT}$ outperforms state-of-the-art competitors across multiple graph datasets of various scales and types, particularly in scenarios involving deep GNNs.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Unlike many parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) techniques that modify model parameters, VP introduces a universal perturbation directly into the input data to facilitate task-specific finetuning while keeping the pretrained model intact. However, there exists a noticeable performance gap between VP and conventional finetuning methods, highlighting an unexplored realm in theory and practice to understand and advance VP to close its performance gap. Towards this end, we introduce a novel concept, termed activation prompt (AP), which extends the scope of input-level VP by enabling universal perturbations to be applied to activation maps within the intermediate layers of the model. With the aid of AP, we show that VP, by its input perturbation design, has intrinsic limitations in both performance and efficiency. By contrast, AP shares a natural connection to normalization tuning, e.g., batch normalization for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer normalization for vision transformers (ViTs). This illuminates the reason behind the observed better accuracy of normalization tuning than VP in the literature. Furthermore, we show that the choice of prompting exhibits a distinct preference for layer depth, with conclusions varying significantly between CNNs and ViTs. We theoretically elucidate the rationale behind such preference by analyzing global features across layers. By conducting extensive experiments across 29 datasets and various model architectures, we provide a thorough performance analysis of AP, comparing it with VP and PEFT baselines. Our experimental results demonstrate that AP significantly surpasses the input-level VP in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, considering factors like time, parameters, memory usage, and throughout. These results further support our new insights into the incapabilities of VP and the capabilities of AP.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Limited gain of efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared with other methods in Table 4 such as LORA etc. The main advantage of AP is the lower cost but other methods are configured to be more expensive than they should be. e.g. this paper experiments with VPT-DEEP with 50 tokens, but (1) VPT also presents VPT-shallow as a more efficient option, (2) VPT by default searches over a set of prompt lengths and in their table 13, a much smaller average token length is needed, e.g. 10 or 1, (3) VPT applied to a deep ViT-L will put VPT in a disadvantage but this could be easily fixed by prompting a subset of layers. As a result, it is not clear where this paper stands in the extensive ablations of VPT.\", \"Questions\": \"As suggested in the weakness section, numbers directly comparable with those reported in VPT paper will facilitate fair comparison.

This contrasts starkly with animals, which demonstrate these capabilities easily. The differences between ML models and animals must stem from particular neural architectures and representations for memory and memory-policy interactions. We propose a new task that requires rapid and continual learning, the sequential Morris Water Maze (sWM). Drawing inspiration from biology, we show that 1) a content-addressable heteroassociative memory based on the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit with grid cells that retain knowledge across diverse environments, and 2) a spatially invariant convolutional network architecture for rapid adaptation across unfamiliar environments together perform rapid learning, good generalization, and continual learning without forgetting. Our model simultaneously outperforms ANN baselines from both the continual and few-shot learning contexts. It retains knowledge of past environments while rapidly acquiring the skills to navigate new ones, thereby addressing the seemingly opposing challenges of quick knowledge transfer and sustaining proficiency in previously learned tasks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In real-world scenarios, however, the efficacy of existing OOD detection methods is often impeded by the inherent imbalance of in-distribution (ID) data, which causes significant performance decline. Through statistical observations, we have identified two common challenges faced by different OOD detectors: misidentifying tail class ID samples as OOD, while erroneously predicting OOD samples as head class from ID. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a generalized statistical framework, termed ImOOD, to formulate the OOD detection problem on imbalanced data distribution. Consequently, the theoretical analysis reveals that there exists a class-aware bias item between balanced and imbalanced OOD detection, which contributes to the performance gap. Building upon this finding, we present a unified perspective of post-hoc normalization and training-time regularization techniques to calibrate and boost the imbalanced OOD detectors. On the representative CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT benchmarks, our method consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art OOD detection approaches by a large margin.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The authors include a helpful intuitive understanding of the bias term that connects it back to the empirical observations about the behavior of OOD detection models under the class-imbalanced setting.\\n- ImOOD is well-motivated and theoretically-grounded on the the above analysis. The general thinking behind the method is sound, and for the most part, it\u2019s described clearly enough to understand and re-implement the design.\", \"Weaknesses\": \"- I believe the major drawback of this paper lies in the limited scope of the studied problem. It appears that the authors assume that the class-imbalance problem only exists on the original ID dataset. I am not too convinced with the practicality of the proposed scenario; it\u2019s hard to imagine in what deployment scenarios only the ID dataset will suffer from this problem, while the OOD dataset(s) used for training/testing is void of it. Wouldn\u2019t it be more natural to assume that the ID training dataset can be refined in advance to make it class-balanced, while the OOD data the detector must be able to identify arise in various forms, and thus is more likely to be class-imbalanced?\\n    - What if the auxiliary OOD dataset used for training and/or the target OOD dataset exhibits class-imbalance as well? I think it is important to study various combinations of class-balanced and -imbalanced ID/auxiliary OOD/target OOD datasets. Does the analysis performed in the paper extend to and hold in such settings? Can ImOOD still outperform other baselines?\\n- Please correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the verification of post-hoc normalization (minus the train-time regularization) on larger datasets appears to be missing. Even on CIFAR10-LT, the improvement from post-hoc normalization seems marginal, but this concern could be alleviated, as long as the improvement is consistent across various datasets. If post-hoc normalization is not quite as effective on datasets, it would signify that ImOOD is heavily reliant on the train-time regularization.\\n- More details on how the label distribution is learned (during test-time regularization) would be appreciated. Also, do you use the same learned label distribution when performing post-hoc normalization? Or is it used only for training-time regularization? If you discard it after training, one would have to know the label distribution anyways for post-hoc normalization, so do we really need to use the learned distribution in the first place?\\n- The empirical validation is limited to one target OOD dataset per InD dataset. Validation on more challenging OOD datasets (e.g., near OOD data, data with spurious correlation) would be helpful to gauge the effectiveness of the proposed method.\", \"Questions\": \"Please refer to the Weaknesses section.\"}"}]}

This results in a decrease in the AUROC, but at the same time, the adversarial clips become noisier, which makes them easier to detect through filtering and creates another avenue for preserving the system's robustness.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This work develops a flow-based model that transports from $P$ to an arbitrary $Q$ where both distributions are only accessible via finite samples. We propose to learn the dynamic optimal transport between $P$ and $Q$ by training a flow neural network. The model is trained to find an invertible transport map between $P$ and $Q$ optimally by minimizing the transport cost. The trained optimal transport flow allows for performing many downstream tasks, including infinitesimal density ratio estimation and distribution interpolation in the latent space for generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed model on high-dimensional data is empirically demonstrated in mutual information estimation, energy-based generative models, and image-to-image translation.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

One popular approach involves the recurrent switching linear dynamical system (rSLDS) model, which describes the latent dynamics of neural spike train data using discrete switches between a finite number of low-dimensional linear dynamical systems. However, a few properties of rSLDS model limit its deployability on trial-varying data, such as a fixed number of states over trials, and no latent structure or organization of states. Here we overcome these limitations by endowing the rSLDS model with a semi-Markov discrete state process, with latent geometry, that captures key properties of stochastic processes over partitions with flexible state cardinality. We leverage partial differential equations (PDE) theory to derive an efficient, semi-parametric formulation for dynamical sufficient statistics to the discrete states. This process, combined with switching dynamics, defines our infinite recurrent switching linear dynamical system (irSLDS) model class. We first validate and demonstrate the capabilities of our model on synthetic data. Next, we turn to the analysis of mice electrophysiological data during decision-making, and uncover strong non-stationary processes underlying both within-trial and trial-averaged neural activity.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Unlike most previous approaches that learn to decompose 2D images, we present DynaVol, a 3D scene generative model that unifies geometric structures and object-centric learning in a differentiable volume rendering framework. The key idea is to perform object-centric voxelization to capture the 3D nature of the scene, which infers the probability distribution over objects at individual spatial locations. These voxel features evolve over time through a canonical-space deformation function, forming the basis for global representation learning via slot attention. The voxel features and global features are complementary and are both leveraged by a compositional NeRF decoder for volume rendering. DynaVol remarkably outperforms existing approaches for unsupervised dynamic scene decomposition. Once trained, the explicitly meaningful voxel features enable additional capabilities that 2D scene decomposition methods cannot achieve: it is possible to freely edit the geometric shapes or manipulate the motion trajectories of the objects.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The paper investigates performance scaling with increasing dataset size, showing improvements. \\n3. The writing is clear, and the authors promise to release code and checkpoints soon.\\n4. The method obtains competitive results.\", \"Weaknesses\": \"The central weaknesses of this paper include the limited novelty of the proposal and the need for appropriate positioning and comparison within existing literature, which require further clarification of some claims.\\n\\n### Novelty\\n1. The proposed architecture closely follows the proposed scheme of ZegFormer [A] with minor modifications, such as not using a pre-trained language encoder and not using an additional image encoder during inference. The proposed method is not compared to ZegFormer, and the differences are not be discussed.\\n2. The scheme of pseudo-mask labelling self-training is similarly widely employed; most recently, CutLER [B] proposes to train an unsupervised segmenter using masks obtained from DINO clustering. \\n3. The use of pseudo-mask generation in the context of OV segmentation has also been explored in DiffuMask [C], which might require further discussion. \\n\\n### Comparisons and Claims\\n4. The paper claims the proposed method P-Seg achieves SOTA results, but the comparative baselines could be more recent. Critically, methods such as OVSegmentor [D], TCL [E] and SegCLIP [F] are not included in comparisons. The lack of such baselines is critical because, based on reported results in the paper, P-Seg would not be SOTA on Pascal VOC (OVSegmentor, TCL) and Context (TCL) and COCO (TCL), which contradicts the bolded claim in the introduction. Additionally, OVSegmentor is trained on smaller datasets and similarly does not use CLIP or ALIGN models, relying instead on DINO (like P-Seg), which offers a closely matched baseline.\\n5. Additionally, the paper compares on the COCO dataset with 80 classes and backgrounds, which matches other papers' descriptions of the COCO-Object dataset. The dataset description might need some additional clarification. CLIPpy results are reported much lower and match those of full COCO (133 classes) rather than COCO-Object (80 classes) from the paper, which might need correcting.\\n6. It might also be more reasonable to include more recent _mask+text_ methods such as OVSeg [G] or ODISE [H] in the comparison to provide a more complete picture of the models and performance attained in the field.\\n6. It should also be clarified in what sense are the methods \\\"zero-shot\\\"? Both P-Seg and P-Seg+ likely observe instance images of the target class during training. This is because the word token embeddings of the corresponding classes in the language model were trained, so training datasets should have contained target classes. P-Seg+ is trained on the training sets of the evaluation datasets, which include classes in question by design. Perhaps the paper uses more of a CLIP-like interpretation of \\\"zero-shot\\\", where the model is not trained on the target classes but on a large dataset of images and text that likely _contained_ such instances. This should be clarified. In any case, P-Seg+ should not be classed as zero-shot since it is trained on the train spits of evaluation datasets. As an alternative, observed/unseen class comparisons could be made like in other zero-shot semantic segmentation papers (e.g. [C]).\\n\\n### Experimental Evaluation\\n7. The paper lacks ablations that confirm the design choices of the method. The ablation presented centres around showing that the method improves with a larger amount of data. However, this confirms the general trend of deep learning methods and is not, arguably,  very surprising. The question of what makes the method work needs to be addressed, as they are critical to understanding and building on top of this work.\\n    - Why use simple K-Means on top of DINO features? Prior methods for extracting masks using DINO features have been developed, such as LOST [I], TokenCut [J], and MaskCut [B], which have achieved state-of-the-art results in unsupervised segmentation with mere modification of the clustering procedure. These also offer better points of comparison to the pseudo-mask extraction method. \\n    - Is setting K=8 critical? This needs to be discussed. How sensitive is the method to this choice? Nouns are extracted from the caption. Why not use the full caption? Why not set K to some function of the number of nouns in the caption?\\n    - Why are language features compared to predicted mask features? An alternative would be to compare the average features used to obtain dense masks. Is this choice critical?\\n    - Why is P-Seg+ using a different architecture and different, now pre-trained, backbone? This avoids the opportunity to initialize from large-scale training of the P-Seg. Is the large-scale VL pre-training detrimental in this case?\\n\\n### Presentation and Clarity\\n8. The paper also needs some crucial details.\\n    - The evaluation protocol for including background could be clearer. How is background class determined in P-Seg/P-Seg+? Is textual prompt used for background? What are textual prompts used for the categories? Prior works rely on templates or prompt expansion to obtain textual prompts for classes. Such details should be included.\\n    - The procedure for self-training should be discussed in detail. In particular, from the description in Sec. 3.3.4, the new model is trained using predictions of the current model, which are described as pixel-dense masks and class labels (Section 3.1, last paragraph). **This makes P-Seg+ a standard closed-set segmentation method, which is not entirely comparable to other methods used in the paper.** If this is the case, then it should be clarified.\\n9. Presentation of qualitative results should clearly indicate that **P-Seg results are obtained using a CRF**, as it is only mentioned in Appendix C and not when such comparisons are discussed. A comparison could be made without CRF to show substantial differences, as other works might similarly benefit from CRF, and CRF might obscure key differences in results.\\n10. It also needs to be clarified why specific models in Tables 3 and 4 have multiple entries with different results for the same dataset. How do these models differ?

However, they come with significant drawbacks, such as long inference time, and challenging training processes. These limitations become even more pronounced when performing high-resolution image restoration tasks. We have noticed that there is a trade-off between models' latency time and their trainability. Including a convolutional module can improve the networks' trainability but not reduce their latency. Conversely, sparsification notably reduces latency but renders networks harder to optimize. To address these issues, a novel Transformer for image restoration called ShareFormer is proposed here. ShareFormer offers optimal performance with lower latency and better trainability than other Transformer-based methods. It achieves this by facilitating the sharing of the attention maps amongst neighboring blocks in the network, thereby considerably improving the inference speed. To maintain the model's information flow integrity, residual connections are added to the \"Value\" of self-attention. Several lesion studies indicate that incorporating residual connections on \"Value\" can aggregate the shallow transformers with shared attention, introducing a local inductive bias and making the network easier to optimize without the need for additional convolution. The effectiveness, efficiency, and easy-to-train of our ShareFormer is supported by numerous experimental results. Our code and pre-trained models will be open-sourced upon publication of the paper.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, Fig.2 illustrates attention map of SPSA is shared to CSAU, while Fig.3 depicts sharing attention map appears after residual connection on $\\\\textit{value}$. The reviewer thinks that the explanation of Eq.(4), (5) is the correct case the authors intended, while the phrase, \\\"**sharing attention map**\\\", in Fig.2 and Fig.3 is confusing.

I cannot find the acceptable evidence from ConViT paper.

Recent solutions for these tasks often train architecture-specific DGMs from scratch, or require iterative fine-tuning and distillation on pre-trained DGMs, both of which take considerable time and hardware investments. More seriously, since the DGMs are established with a discrete pre-defined upsampling scale, they cannot well match the emerging requirements of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR), where a unified model adapts to arbitrary upsampling scales, instead of preparing a series of distinct models for each case. These limitations beg an intriguing question: can we identify the ASSR capability of existing pre-trained DGMs without the need for distillation or fine-tuning? In this paper, we take a step towards resolving this matter by proposing Diff-SR, a first ASSR attempt based solely on pre-trained DGMs, without additional training efforts. It is motivated by an exciting finding that a simple methodology, which first injects a specific amount of noise into the low-resolution images before invoking a DGM\u2019s backward diffusion process, outperforms current leading solutions. The key insight is determining a suitable amount of noise to inject, i.e., small amounts lead to poor low-level fidelity, while over-large amounts degrade the high-level signature. Through a finely-grained theoretical analysis, we propose the Perceptual Recoverable Field (PRF), a metric that achieves the optimal trade-off between these two factors. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness, flexibility, and adaptability of Diff-SR, demonstrating superior performance to state-of-the-art solutions under diverse ASSR environments.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

As the growth of open-source preference datasets, reward models, and language models has enabled wider experimentation, RLHF's benefits have been demonstrated in settings beyond general chat agents, including web question answering, summarization, and multi-turn dialogue. However, RLHF has also been consistently observed to drive models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates that optimizing for response length is a significant factor behind RLHF's reported improvements on helpfulness. First, we study the relationship between reward and length for reward models trained on three open-source preference datasets. In these settings, length correlates strongly with reward, and improvements in reward score are driven in large part by shifting the distribution over output lengths. We then explore interventions during both RL and reward model learning to see if we can achieve the same downstream improvements as RLHF without increasing length. While our interventions mitigate length increases, they aren't uniformly effective across settings. Furthermore, we find that even running RLHF with a reward based solely on length can reproduce most of the downstream improvements over the initial policy model, showing that reward models in these settings have a long way to go.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

A salient feature of the brain that allows effective CL is that it utilizes multiple modalities for learning and inference, which is underexplored in DNNs. Therefore, we study the role and interactions of multiple modalities in mitigating forgetting and introduce a benchmark for multi-modal continual learning. Our findings demonstrate that leveraging multiple views and complementary information from multiple modalities enables the model to learn more accurate and robust representations of the objects that are less vulnerable to modality-specific regularities and considerably mitigates forgetting. Furthermore, we observe that individual modalities exhibit varying degrees of robustness to distribution shift. Finally, we propose a method for integrating and aligning the information from different modalities by utilizing the relational structural similarities between the data points in each modality. Our method sets a strong baseline that enables both single- and multimodal inference. Our study provides a promising case for further exploring the role of multiple modalities in enabling CL and provides a standard benchmark for future research.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Despite a plethora of algorithms developed to date, no widely accepted, publicly available last-mile delivery dataset exists to support research in this field. In this paper, we introduce LaDe, the first publicly available last-mile delivery dataset with millions of packages from the industry. LaDe has three unique characteristics:  (1) Large-scale. It involves 10,677k packages of 21k couriers over 6 months of real-world operation. (2) Comprehensive information. It offers original package information, such as its location and time requirements, as well as task-event information, which records when and where the courier is while events such as task-accept and task-finish events happen.  (3) Diversity. The dataset includes data from various scenarios, including package pick-up and delivery, and from multiple cities, each with its unique spatio-temporal patterns due to their distinct characteristics such as populations. We verify LaDe on three tasks by running several classical baseline models per task. We believe that the large-scale, comprehensive, diverse feature of LaDe can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the supply chain community, data mining community,  and beyond.

The dataset outlined in this research paper reveals certain limitations with respect to its incorporation of road network structure, a pivotal aspect for applications pertaining to pick-up and delivery services. Predominantly relying on GPS locations(x-y coordinates), while undoubtedly valuable, might not comprehensively address the intricacies inherent in real-world logistics operations. The absence of road network information in the dataset does raise valid concerns about its suitability for applications necessitating an in-depth understanding of spatial constraints and the optimization of routing, particularly in the last-mile express domain. To augment the dataset's applicability in such scenarios, it may prove advantageous to contemplate the inclusion of coarse-grained road network data. While acknowledging the privacy concerns associated with road network information, providing a more generalized form of road network data could still facilitate researchers in achieving a more comprehensive and accurate representation of the real-world scenarios under examination.\\n\\nW3. The dataset should acknowledge the significant impact of rush hours and traffic congestion on logistics. It is important to recognize that the road network structure undergoes dynamic and temporal changes over the course of several months. Therefore, it becomes paramount to incorporate a dynamic road network structure within the dataset that can adapt to and depict the wide-ranging traffic conditions and road configurations at different times. This dynamic approach not only bolsters the dataset's precision and relevance but also furnishes researchers with a more authentic representation of the continually evolving real-world logistics and last-mile delivery scenarios.\\n\\nW4.

Current methods for building effective pretraining datasets heavily rely on annotated 3D meshes, point clouds, and camera parameters from simulated environments, preventing them from building datasets from real-world data sources where such metadata is lacking. We propose a pretraining dataset-curation approach that does not require any additional annotations. Our method allows us to generate multi-view datasets from both real-world videos and simulated environments at scale. Specifically, we experiment with two scales: MIMIC-1M with 1.3M and MIMIC-3M with 3.1M multi-view image pairs. We train multiple models with different masked image modeling objectives to showcase the following findings: Representations trained on our automatically generated MIMIC-3M outperform those learned from expensive crowdsourced datasets (ImageNet-1K) and those learned from synthetic environments (MULTIVIEW-HABITAT) on two dense geometric tasks: depth estimation on NYUv2 (\u21911.7%), and surface normals estimation on Taskonomy (\u21932.05%). For dense tasks which also require object understanding, we outperform MULTIVIEW- HABITAT, on semantic segmentation on ADE20K (\u21913.89%), pose estimation on MSCOCO (\u21919.4%), and reduce the gap with models pre-trained on the object-centric expensive ImageNet-1K. We outperform even when the representations are frozen, and when downstream training data is limited to few-shot. Larger dataset (MIMIC-3M) significantly improves performance, which is promising since our curation method can arbitrarily scale to produce even larger datasets.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Here we take advantage of generative model architectures to address both the prediction and design of RNA splicing condition-specific outcome. First, we construct a predictive model, TrASPr, which combines multiple transformers along with side information to predict splicing in a tissue specific manner. Then, we exploit TrASPr as on Oracle to produce labeled data for a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm with a costume loss function for RNA splicing outcome design.

Here are the main issues:\\n\\n1. The authors focus on differential splicing and use splicing profiles across multiple tissues and species to train their model. However, they do not present any immediate benefits. For instance, they do not provide information on how much SpliceAI (Jaganathan et al., 2019) loses in performance, or how much Traspr gains, by having a universal (tissue-agnostic) model for splicing. In Section 4.1, the authors themselves acknowledge that \\\"[...] predictions for tissue-specific splicing changes were not very accurate, and we, therefore, did not include them here.\\\"\\n\\n2. The manuscript lacks convincing performance comparisons. It is challenging to believe that Traspr outperforms Pangolin (and subsequently SpliceAI) by such a significant margin (Spearman correlation 0.81 vs. 0.17). SpliceAI and other methods have undergone extensive testing by independent researchers. Furthermore, the approach for calculating cassette exon inclusion in Pangolin, as described in the manuscript, may not be optimal, as it ignores the upstream and downstream exon junctions. A more appropriate method can be found in the Methods section of the SpliceAI paper.\\n\\n3. Traspr appears to excel at predicting constitutive and non-constitutive exons but performs poorly for exons that fall in between (the truly alternatively spliced exons). It might provide more insight if the tested exons were categorized accordingly (e.g., see Fig. 1C in the SpliceAI paper).\\n\\n4. The manuscript lacks a comparison with the AE+MLP model, which is trained only on mouse data and is not considered state of the art.\\n\\n5. The authors only examine Daam1 mutations published in (Barash et al., 2010), while numerous datasets have been published since then, e.g., in (Xiong et al. 2015) and (Jaganathan et al., 2019), among many others.\\n\\n6. When evaluating the Bayesian optimization (BO) method for sequence design, other datasets could be considered, such as the SMA dataset in (Xiong et al. 2015).\\n\\nMinor Comments:\\n- Not all figure panels are labeled, and some figure references are incorrect, e.g., Fig. 1b in subsection 3.1.1.\\n- Some tables have two values in some cells, and it is not clear what these values represent, e.g., in Tables 1 and 2.\\n- Fig. 1 is too small and challenging to read.\", \"Questions\": \"I find the sequence design aspect of this manuscript interesting and promising. I have a couple of questions on that:\\n\\n1. Is the Transformer model truly necessary here? Could the VAE be used to obtain representations and then be fed into the MLP? Essentially, could a single splice junction model be trained instead of a Transformer and a VAE?\\n2. On the same topic, it would be beneficial to understand how a model like SpliceAI, followed by an MLP, would perform as the oracle. I'm not convinced that the Transformer-based splice site detection (with a 400bp context) outperforms SpliceAI with a 10kb context.\\n3. Assuming that a tissue-specific splicing model works (which needs to be demonstrated), can the BO method be adapted to modify AS only in a specific tissue, such as the brain?\"}"}]}

One of the key challenges in CSLR is accurately capturing the intricate hand movements involved. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-modal framework that first combines video, keypoints, and optical flow modalities to extract more representative features. We investigate various fusion techniques to effectively integrate the information from these modalities.\nFurthermore, we introduce a hierarchical knowledge distillation (HKD) framework to alleviate the computational burden associated with extracting keypoints and optical flow information. This framework enables the hierarchical transfer of knowledge from multiple modalities to a single-modal CSLR model, ensuring high performance while reducing computational costs.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily.

The advantage of this method is that while enjoying multi-modal knowledge from the teacher model, the student model itself does not need to take additional modality inputs such as optical flow and pose, where such extra modalities actually incur computational overhead during inference time.\\n\\n- The presentation for the effect of each proposed component is quite clear from both teacher-side and student-side. For the teacher side, improvements are gradually observed when more modalities are combined, and more fusion layers are applied (Table 3). From the student-side, similar to the teacher model, the performance increases when the knowledge distillation loss terms are applied in feature levels and the output-level (Table 4b). \\n\\n- Compared to the provided previous CSLR methods, the proposed scheme achieves strong results in both cases of multi-modal network and single-modal network in some standard CSLR benchmarks.\", \"Weaknesses\": \"[Major]\\n- Although the overall flow of the technical design is plausible, the proposed SignKD framework combines two existing components well-established in literature (i.e., multi-modal fusion layer and feature-level knowledge distillation), which is not an astounding result and can weaken the technical novelty of the work. As submitted to a top-tier ML conference, further theoretical or intuitive insight on the architectural design would be expected.\\n\\n- The claim for the state-of-the-art performance in CSLR tasks needs to be reconsidered. Specifically for the video-only methods, is the video-based backbone S3D pretrained on video data, or initialized from scratch? While the most performant baseline SEN (Hu et al., 2023c) is based on the architecture with frame-level 2D CNN followed by LSTM, but the proposed work adopts a strong video backbone. Such architectural differences and the following advantages should be acknowledged when comparing performances. Can the proposed work still achieve superior performances even when built upon such frame-level architecture? In addition, for the multi-modal-based experiments, comparison with baseline methods in the same modality condition is missing. For example, how much the performance drop would be observed when the same kind of modalities with baseline methods (i.e., video+pose) are used for training the final multi-modal teacher model?\\n\\n[Minor]\\n- For the additional techniques explained in Appendix C. in detail, missing citation for the sign pyramid network [Chen et al., 2022]. In addition, frame-level supervision has been also previously explored [Min et al., 2021, Hao et al., 2021, Jang et al., 2023]. Further discussions on advantages or differences of the proposed work compared to previous works would be more helpful for potential readers.\\n\\n- Computational aspects for the proposed model are missing. Batch size during training is not provided. In addition, as the training cost for a CSLR model is highly demanding, it would be beneficial to share total training hours and required VRAM memory. Moreover, how many frames the final student model can process during inference (i.e., FPS)? Considering real-world deployment, reporting such quantities and comparing with existing CSLR methods is suggested. \\n\\n- For the ablation results from Table 4(b), one additional row corresponding to the result where only CTC and O are marked is expected. This can be compared with the item where all the feature-level distillation losses are applied (the last row). \\n\\n- Related to the reproducibility, it is unclear whether the codes for training and inference would be released. If there is no plan to open the codes, could you provide a brief reason?\", \"Questions\": \"[Questions, discussions and suggestions]\\n\\n- Considering current standard CSLR benchmarks such as PHOENIX-2014, in my opinion, it would be relatively easy for a model to capture motion information of a signer since it has uniform background and the only component with motion is caused by a human. Related to this, it would be interesting to see the stress-testing result for the already trained model on challenging environments [Jang et al., 2022].   \\n\\n- Presenting sample-level qualitative visualizations such as feature activation map for a signer or gloss-level predictions on some video sequences is suggested, as usually done in CSLR literature. It would be valuable to explore whether such visualizations show different characteristics depending on the single-modal (student) network and multi-modal (teacher) network. \\n\\n- The proposed model includes a lot of loss terms with each weighting factor. Are those weight values sensitive to different datasets? \\n\\n- Inconsistent notations for Table.

In addition, it is not sufficient to claim as SOTA at this version. It needs to be more rigorous to compare with previous baselines beyond considering just error rates.

In this work we design a Unified Voxelization framework for explicit learning of scene representations, dubbed UniVoxel, which allows for efficient modeling of the geometry, materials and illumination, thereby accelerating the inverse rendering substantially. To be specific, we propose to encode a scene into a latent volumetric representation, based on which the geometry, materials and illumination can be readily learned via lightweight neural networks in a unified manner. Particularly, we leverage Spherical Gaussians to represent the incident light radiance, which enables the seamless integration of modeling illumination into the unified voxelization framework. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks covering diverse scenes demonstrate that UniVoxel boosts the optimization efficiency significantly compared to other inverse rendering methods, reducing the per-scene training time from hours to 18 minutes, while achieving favorable reconstruction quality.

Since generated outputs directly suffer from dataset bias, mitigating latent bias becomes a key factor in improving sample quality and proportion. This paper proposes time-dependent importance reweighting to mitigate the bias for the diffusion models. We demonstrate that the time-dependent density ratio becomes more precise than previous approaches, thereby minimizing error propagation in generative learning. While directly applying it to score-matching is intractable, we discover that using the time-dependent density ratio both for reweighting and score correction can lead to a tractable form of the objective function to regenerate the unbiased data density. Furthermore, we theoretically establish a connection with traditional score-matching, and we demonstrate its convergence to an unbiased distribution. The experimental evidence supports the usefulness of the proposed method, which outperforms baselines including time-independent importance reweighting on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, FFHQ, and CelebA with various bias settings.

In this paper, we propose a novel predictive statistical model called the Online Sparse Residual Tree (OSRT) for handling streaming multivariate scattered data. OSRT is based on online tree decomposition and online adaptive radial basis function (RBF) exploration. OSRT dynamically expands its network depth as more data arrives, and incorporates a sparse and appropriate RBF refinement at each child node to minimize the residual error from its parent node. OSRT also uses an incremental method to explore the central node of the RBF function, ensuring both sparsity and accuracy of the model. When the network reaches its maximum depth, the OSRT model updates the RBF approximation of its final layer based on the most recent data. This ensures that the model captures the latest trends in the evolving data. We evaluate our algorithm on several datasets, and compare it with existing online RBF methods. From the results, it is shown that OSRT achieves higher efficiency and accuracy.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

While cognitive science emphasizes the significance of spatial context in the formation and retrieval of episodic memory, the current primary approach to implementing episodic memory in AI systems is through transformers that store temporally ordered experiences, which overlooks the spatial dimension. As a result, it is unclear how the underlying structure could be extended to incorporate the spatial axis beyond temporal order alone and thereby what benefits can be obtained. To address this, this paper explores the use of Spatially-Aware Transformer models that incorporate spatial information. These models enable the creation of place-centric episodic memory that considers both temporal and spatial dimensions. Adopting this approach, we demonstrate that memory utilization efficiency can be improved, leading to enhanced accuracy in various place-centric downstream tasks. Additionally, we propose the Adaptive Memory Allocator, a memory management method based on reinforcement learning that aims to optimize efficiency of memory utilization. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed model in various environments and across multiple downstream tasks, including prediction, generation, reasoning, and reinforcement learning.

I believe many arguments and thoughts presented in this paper will be very constructive to relevant future research.\", \"Weaknesses\": \"- The title of this paper is very misleading\\n    - The paper does not propose any new formation of the transformer architecture to better model spatial information, but focuses on managing agents' episodic memory for addressing different downstream tasks. \\n\\n- This paper overclaims several contributions.\\n    - The paper says \\\"we are the first to motivate, conceptualize, and introduce the notion of transformers capable of utilizing explicit spatial information\\\", but as the authors mentioned that defining and managing external memory have been extensively studied in previous machine learning literatures. It simply compares place- and time-centric store and hierarchical read methods that are intuitively suitable for different downstream tasks.\\n    - One good example is the use of topological graph that stores observations of keypoints for agents in visual navigation, e.g., the widely applied DUET agent [1] for vision-and-language navigation [2], which is essentially close to the proposed SAT-PM-PH model. \\n    - The experiments of action-conditioned image generation (Exp-5) and reinforcement learning agents (3.3) are not very convincing to me. Exp-5 is not a practical setting and 3.3 is relatively simple that cannot represent other reinforcement learning agents, see more below.\\n\\n- Missing experiments.\\n    - I think this paper lacks investigation on the more recent embodied agents and their memory management approaches. \\n    - The experiments presented in this paper are relatively small-scale and simple. I am concerning how the proposed methods might impact recent research that often apply more capable networks (and massive data) to learn generic spatiotemporal priors to facilitate representing and memorizing the observations. e.g., Figure 3 - an agent might be able to create a very compact representation for all ballet rooms from a single visit to each room? \\n    - Following my previous point, I think this study emphasizes the scenario of memory constraint, but the experiments only considers small memory capacity, negelating the difference in representation (i.e., how to store an observation) and the difficulty in grounding from the queries to relevant memories. Overall, the generalization and practical influence of the proposed methods is not very clear to me.\\n    - I think a valuable baseline is missing here: without explicitly defining any memory management strategies but gives the agent a certain memory budget and asks it to learn to update the memory by itself by training the agent on a mixture of data and tasks (e.g., a more general version of DNC mentioned in Appendix D.4).\\n\\n[1] Think Global, Act Local: Dual-scale Graph Transformer for Vision-and-Language Navigation.

Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with a vector quantization bottleneck at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior.\nWe validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. Our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Furthermore, quantizing features with codebooks is a popular technique which the work demonstrates leads to a minimal degradation in model performance.\\n* Experiments with the TokFSM dataset are intuitive and clearly demonstrate the ability to intervene in the output of a transformer trained with codebook quantization. Experiments such as the JS divergence with the target token distribution in Figure 4, are used to demonstrate effective intervention. Given that one has access to the semanticity of entries in the learned codebook, the proposed method seems to be effective at steering the output of transformer network.\\n* The work contains a comprehensive related works section in the appendix that clarifies the benefits of a discrete codebook over using a dictionary approach (referred to as \u201cfeatures-as-directions\u201d)\", \"Weaknesses\": \"* One shortcoming of the experiment in table 1 is that it has two dependent variables: both the quantization level k and the codebook size C. It is important to ablate changes to these two variables separately to better understand if they both independently provide benefits. There is a similar issue of two dependent variables being tested at the same time in Table 2 where both k is modified as well the features being quantized (i.e., attention vs mlp features). \\n* The benefit of sparsity in the combination of codebook entries has not been clearly articulated. In fact, in section F.1.1 of the manuscript, it is argued that the continuous combination of different atoms reduces interpretability. Selecting codebook entries via top-k cosine similarity is a naive approach that has not been compared to more recent sparse coding techniques (e.g., variational sparse coding methods like in Tonolini et al. 2020 and Fallah et al. 2022). Except for the potential increase in modeling capacity, the work does not demonstrate the benefit of quantizing with multiple codebook entries per token.\\n* Interpretation of codebook entries still seems to require manual intervention. It requires a user to find input data for which a codebook entry is often activated, which can be timely and costly. It is unclear how one would use current methods to find a codebook entry that corresponds with a certain semantic concept without manually performing a forward pass using data corresponding to that concept.\\n\\n\\nMinor:\\n* Some citations need revising in the bibliography (e.g., \u201cOn the role of scientific thought\u201d).\", \"Questions\": \"* Can the authors clarify the benefit from increasing k? Since the authors use cosine similarity between the activations and the codebook to pick the top-k entries, what would the difference be between each of these k codebook entries? It seems that taking k entries contradicts the viewpoint of \u201cfeatures-as-points\u201d, and may even lead to what the authors refer to as \u201csmuggling of information\u201d. I would expect that increasing k may improve performance of the model, at potential cost to interpretability.\\n* Out of curiosity, have the authors considered quantizing each vector along the feature components (i.e., divide the N features of each token into k blocks)? Is this what the authors refer to as \u201cgrouped codebooks\u201d in E3? If so, I believe this warrants discussion and attention in the main text. This would be an alternative to quantizing each token with k codebook entries that are very close in cosine similarity and be closer to the VQ-VAE setting.\\n* The notation and presentation of the different loss terms in section 2.1 can be made more clear. In the cross-entropy loss, x is used to denote a categorical random variable corresponding to a token being selected. In the reconstruction loss, to my understanding, x is referring to a continuous random variable corresponding to the activation in an intermediary layer, even though the variable a is used in an earlier section. Furthermore, k-codes are combined to quantize each activation. Is the MSE taken with the sum of these codes or each code individually?\"}"}]}

While existing geometric features and pretrained representations have demonstrated promising results, they usually treat pockets independent of ligands, neglecting the fundamental interactions between them. However, the limited pocket-ligand complex structures available in the PDB database (less than 100 thousand non-redundant pairs) hampers large-scale pretraining endeavors for interaction modeling. To address this constraint, we propose a novel pocket pretraining approach that leverages knowledge from high-resolution atomic protein structures, assisted by highly effective pretrained small molecule representations. By segmenting protein structures into drug-like fragments and their corresponding pockets, we obtain a reasonable simulation of ligand-receptor interactions, resulting in the generation of over 5 million complexes. Subsequently, the pocket encoder is trained in a contrastive manner to align with the representation of pseudo-ligand furnished by some pretrained small molecule encoders. Our method, named ProFSA, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, including pocket druggability prediction, pocket matching, and ligand binding affinity prediction. Notably, ProFSA surpasses other pretraining methods by a substantial margin. Moreover, our work opens up a new avenue for mitigating the scarcity of protein-ligand complex data through the utilization of high-quality and diverse protein structure databases.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features.  Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones.

Previous generic NeRFs combine multiview stereo techniques with image-based neural rendering, yielding impressive results, while suffering from three issues. First, occlusions often result in inconsistent feature matching. Then, they deliver distortions and artifacts in geometric discontinuities and locally sharp shapes due to their individual process of sampled points and rough feature aggregation. Third, their image-based representations experience severe degradations\nwhen source views are not near enough to the target view. To address challenges, we propose the first paradigm that constructs the generalizable neural field based on point-based rather than image-based rendering, which we call the Generalizable neural Point Field (GPF). Our approach explicitly models visibilities by geometric priors and augments them with neural features. We propose a novel nonuniform log sampling strategy to improve rendering speed and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we present a learnable kernel spatially augmented\nwith features for feature aggregations, mitigating distortions at places with drastically varying geometries. Besides, our representation can be easily manipulated. Experiments show that our model can deliver better geometries, view consistencies, and rendering quality than all counterparts and benchmarks on three datasets in both generalization and finetuning settings, preliminarily proving the potential of the new paradigm for generalizable NeRF\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, many real-world applications usually face the label insufficient scenario, where there exist limited or even no labeled samples but abundant unlabeled samples. Under those scenarios, the ERM cannot be directly applied to tackle them. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Label-encoding Risk Minimization (LRM), which draws inspiration from the phenomenon of neural collapse. Specifically, the proposed LRM first estimates the label encodings through prediction means for unlabeled samples and then aligns them with their corresponding ground-truth label encodings. As a result, the LRM takes both the prediction discriminability and diversity into account and can be utilized as a plugin in existing models to address scenarios with insufficient labels. Theoretically, we analyze the relationship between the LRM and ERM. Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of the LRM under several label insufficient scenarios, including semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaptation, and semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation.

One approach to identifying a desirable initialization scheme involves analyzing the behavior of the input-output Jacobian and ensuring that it does not degenerate exponentially with depth. Such an analysis has been conducted in previous works, such as Pennington et al. (2017), where the authors discovered a critical initializa- tion scheme that ensures Jacobian stability, as confirmed by empirical results. The analysis carried in such studies is limited to initialization and leverages classical results in random matrix theory. In this paper, we extend this analysis beyond initialization, and study Jacobian behaviour during training. Notably, we show that a notion of stability holds throughout training (if satisfied at initialization), hence providing a theoretical explanation for the crucial role of initialization. To do this, we first prove a general theorem that utilizes recent breakthrough results in random matrix theory (Brailovskaya and van Handel, 2022). To show the broad applicability of our framework, we also provide an analysis of the Jacobian in other scenarios such as sparse Networks and non-iid initialization.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

As a natural extension, open-set recognition (OSR) requires models to reject samples of unknown classes that are not encountered in the training phase. Traditional discriminative models struggle to learn decision boundaries for OSR due to the absence of unknown samples. This has led to existing methods focusing on either CSR or OSR, as optimizing one often results in performance degradation of the other. In this paper, we offer a formalization for OSR based on learning theory, demonstrating that CSR and OSR share the same goal for generative models. Motivated by this core insight, we introduce a neural Latent Gaussian Mixture Model (L-GMM) accompanied by a collaborative training algorithm. The model consists of an encoder that maps inputs to a latent space, and a density estimator that computes probability densities. The end-to-end training algorithm, designed in a collaborative manner, learns the density estimator through maximum likelihood estimation and trains the encoder using a discriminative loss derived from the generative model. This framework yields a model capable of performing both CSR and OSR. Experimental results show that L-GMM outperforms its discriminative counterparts in image recognition and segmentation in CSR with models trained from scratch. These models also outperform other specialized methods when directly applied to OSR without any modifications or prior knowledge.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Presently, most MDTC approaches that embrace adversarial training and the shared-private paradigm exhibit cutting-edge performance. Unfortunately, these methods face a non-negligible challenge: the absence of theoretical guarantees in the design of MDTC algorithms. The dearth of theoretical underpinning poses a substantial impediment to the advancement of MDTC algorithms. To tackle this problem, we first provide a theoretical analysis of MDTC by decomposing the MDTC task into multiple domain adaptation tasks. We incorporate the margin discrepancy as the measure of domain divergence and establish a new generalization bound based on Rademacher complexity. Subsequently, we propose a margin discrepancy-based adversarial training (MDAT) approach for MDTC, in accordance with our theoretical analysis. To validate the efficacy of the proposed MDAT method, we conduct empirical studies on two MDTC benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate that our MDAT approach surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on both datasets.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

For applications with privacy and low latency requirements, the compute and memory demands imposed by continual learning can be cost-prohibitive for resource-constraint edge platforms. Reducing computational precision through fully quantized training (FQT) simultaneously reduces memory footprint and increases compute efficiency for both training and inference. However, aggressive quantization especially integer FQT typically degrades model accuracy to unacceptable levels. In this paper, we propose a technique that leverages inexpensive Hadamard transforms to enable low-precision training with only integer matrix multiplications. We further determine which tensors need stochastic rounding and propose tiled matrix multiplication to enable low-bit width accumulators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on several human activity recognition datasets and CIFAR100 in a class incremental learning setting. We achieve less than 0.5% and 3% accuracy degradation while we quantize all matrix multiplications inputs down to 4-bits with 8-bit accumulators.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, experimental or computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), are time-consuming and labor-intensive for obtaining this conformation. Deep learning (DL) based molecular representation learning (MRL) has made significant advancements in molecular modeling and has achieved remarkable results in various tasks. Consequently, it has emerged as a promising approach for directly predicting the ground-state conformation of molecules. In this regard, we introduce GTMGC, a novel network based on Graph-Transformer (GT) that seamlessly predicts the spatial configuration of molecules in a 3D space from their 2D topological architecture in an end-to-end manner. Moreover, we propose a novel self-attention mechanism called Molecule Structural Residual Self-Attention (MSRSA) for molecular structure modeling. This mechanism not only guarantees high model performance and easy implementation but also lends itself well to other molecular modeling tasks. Our method has been evaluated on the Molecule3D benchmark dataset and the QM9 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable performance and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods as well as the widely used open-source software RDkit.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, real-world audio creation aims to generate harmonious audio containing various elements such as speech, music, and sound effects with controllable conditions, which is challenging to address using existing audio generation systems. We present WavJourney, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect various audio models for audio creation. WavJourney allows users to create storytelling audio content with diverse audio elements simply from textual descriptions. Specifically, given a text instruction, WavJourney first prompts LLMs to generate an audio script that serves as a structured semantic representation of audio elements. The audio script is then converted into a computer program, where each line of the program calls a task-specific audio generation model or computational operation function. The computer program is then executed to obtain a compositional and interpretable solution for audio creation. Experimental results suggest that WavJourney is capable of synthesizing realistic audio aligned with textually-described semantic, spatial and temporal conditions, achieving state-of-the-art results on text-to-audio generation benchmarks. Additionally, we introduce a new multi-genre story benchmark. Subjective evaluations demonstrate the potential of WavJourney in crafting engaging storytelling audio content from text. We further demonstrate that WavJourney can facilitate human-machine co-creation in multi-round dialogues.

Existing strategies can achieve the attack goal but usually assume that the victim employs the same training method as what the adversary uses to mount the attack. In this paper, we argue that this assumption is strong, since the victim may choose any learning algorithm to train the model as long as it achieves some targeted performance on clean data. In addition, we observe a large decrease in the effectiveness of prior poisoning attacks, when the victim uses a different learning paradigm to train the model, and marked differences in frequency-level characteristics between perturbations generated with different learners and attack methods. To enhance the attack transferability, we propose _Transferable Poisoning_, which generates high-frequency poisoning perturbations by alternately leveraging the gradient information with two specific algorithms respectively selected from supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning paradigms. Through extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets, we show that transferable poisoning can produce poisoned samples with significantly improved transferability, which not only applies to the two learners used to devise the attack but also works for learning algorithms and even paradigms beyond.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The authors should check their code regarding the CL and SupCL evaluation for poisoning attacks, especially how transforms (augmentations) are performed when preparing the poisoned dataset. It seems that the data augmentation for each image is fixed before the CL (SupCL) training starts in their code. For example, in this case, each positive pair consists of two fixed augmented images. However, the CL (SupCL) algorithm applies different data augmentations each time it reads an image. Once this part of code is not properly configured, the reliability of the algorithm is questionable. For these reasons, I have significant concerns about the CL and SupCL evaluation results reported in this paper.\\n2. The novelty of the proposed method is limited.

The proposed algorithm even does not explicitly optimize the frequency of perturbations. In Figure 4, all four attacks are high-frequency but three of them, namely CC, SCP, and WTP have poor transferability. Does it contradict the claim?\\n5. Besides the first concern about CL evaluation, I have also concerns about the comparison of attack performance.\\n(1)\\tTable 1,2,4 do not consider BYOL that was used in the paper of CP.

While the inherent biases in common graph data are involved in GNN training, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output perturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during training. The Lipschitz bound, a technique from robust statistics, can limit the maximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account associated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method to examine the output stability of machine learning models without incurring additional computational costs. Recently, its use in controlling the stability of Euclidean neural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz bound remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs, especially within fairness contexts. However, no existing research has investigated Lipschitz bounds to shed light on stabilizing the GNN outputs, especially when working on graph data with implicit biases. To narrow this gap, we begin with the general GNNs operating on relational data, and formulate a Lipschitz bound to limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input. Additionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz bound of a GNN model could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from data for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's effectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training dynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can effectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and fairness.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In this work we consider noisy training as a special case of optimization by continuation, also known as graduated non-convexity, where a convex version of the objective function is solved first and slowly morphed into the original non-convex function. When using continuation in machine learning problems, we show that saddle points require special consideration, as they may get the optimizer stuck in local minima. With a form of regularization applied to the continuation optimizer, we show on several test problems that this approach reduces the risk of being trapped in local minima, leading to better training for very deep architectures and non-convex loss functions.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Does injecting noise with the different distribution really help and if yes in what circumstance in a high dimensional loss landscape?

However, standard UDA requires access to source data and models, prohibiting its practical application in terms of privacy and security. Black-Box DA (BDA) reduces such constraints by defining a pseudo label from a single source prediction, which allows for self-training of the target model. Nonetheless, existing methods have limited consideration for multi-source settings, in which multiple source domains are available to generate pseudo labels. In this work, we introduce a novel training framework for multi-source BDA (MSBDA), dubbed Label Space-Induced Pseudo Label Refinement (LPR). Specifically, LPR incorporates a Pseudo label Refinery Network (PRN) that learns the relation between each source conditioned by the target from source predictions. The target model is adapted by self-learning using a pseudo label generated by PRN. We provide theoretical supports for the performance of the LPR. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSBDA using LPR achieves highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches with different DA settings.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In the context of dense matching, many works benefit from one of two forms of aggregation: feature aggregation, which pertains to the alignment of similar features, or cost aggregation, a procedure aimed at instilling coherence in the flow estimates across neighboring pixels. In this work, we first show that feature aggregation and cost aggregation exhibit distinct characteristics and reveal the potential for substantial benefits stemming from the judicious use of both aggregation processes. We then introduce a simple yet effective architecture that harnesses self- and cross-attention mechanisms to show that our approach unifies feature aggregation and cost aggregation and effectively harnesses the strengths of both techniques. Within the proposed attention layers, the features and cost volume both complement each other, and the attention layers are interleaved through a coarse-to-fine design to further promote accurate correspondence estimation. Finally at inference, our network produces multi-scale predictions, computes their confidence scores, and selects the most confident flow for final prediction. Our framework is evaluated on standard benchmarks for semantic matching, and also applied to geometric matching, where we show that our approach achieves significant improvements compared to existing methods.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing DFML methods construct pseudo tasks from a learnable dataset, which is iteratively inversed from a collection of pre-trained models. However, such distribution of pseudo tasks is not stationary and can be easily corrupted by specific attack, which causes (i) Task-Distribution Shift (TDS): the distribution of tasks will change as the learnable dataset gets updated, making the meta-learner biased and susceptible to overfitting on new tasks, ultimately harming its long-term generalization performance. (ii) Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC): the task distribution can be easily corrupted by deliberately injecting deceptive out-of-distribution models, termed as model poisoning attack. To address these issues, for the first time, we call for and develop robust DFML. Specifically, (i) for handling TDS, we propose a new memory-based DFML baseline (TEAPOT) via meta-learning from a pseudo task distribution. TEAPOT maintains the memory of old tasks to prevent over-reliance on new tasks, with an interpolation mechanism combining classes from different tasks to diversify the pseudo task distribution; (ii) for further defending against TDC, we propose a defense strategy, Robust Model Selection Policy (ROSY), which is compatible with existing DFML methods (e.g., ROSY + TEAPOT). ROSY adaptively ranks and then selects reliable models according to a learnable reliability score, which is optimized by policy gradient due to the non-differentiable property of model selection. Extensive experiments show the superiority of TEAPOT over existing baselines for handling TDS and verify the effectiveness of ROSY + DFML for further improving robustness against TDC.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

We argue that truly understanding values in LLMs requires considering both \"know what\" and \"know why\". To this end, we present the Value Understanding Measurement (VUM) framework that quantitatively assess both \"know what\" and \"know why\" by measuring the discriminator-critique gap related to human values. Using the Schwartz Value Survey, we specify our evaluation values and develop a thousand-level dialogue dataset with GPT-4. Our assessment looks at both the value alignment of LLM's outputs compared to baseline answers and how LLM responses align with reasons for value recognition versus GPT-4's annotations. We evaluate five representative LLMs and provide strong evidence that the scaling law significantly impacts \"know what\" but not much on \"know why\", which has consistently maintained a high level. This may further suggest that LLMs might craft plausible explanations based on the provided context without truly understanding their inherent value, indicating potential risks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

How is that possible to make such a claim without knowing the details of the two models?\\n  - I am also not convinced by the \\\"know why\\\" argument. Seen from Figure 3 and Figure 4, all models achieve quite similar scores. However, could it be that the GPT-4 doesn't have the capability to distinguish those models' outputs from the baseline reason? I saw the authors mentioned they did some kind of human study in Appendix B.2, but all the details about this human study is missing.

Currently, overfitting remains a critical problem in event-based classification tasks for Spiking Neural Network (SNN) due to its relatively weak spatial representation capability. Data augmentation is a simple but efficient method to alleviate overfitting and improve the generalization ability of neural networks, and saliency-based augmentation methods are proven to be effective in the image processing field. However, there is no approach available for extracting saliency maps from SNNs. Therefore, for the first time, we present Spiking Layer-Time-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLTRP) and Spiking Layer-wise Relevance Propagation rule (SLRP) in order for SNN to generate stable and accurate CAMs and saliency maps. Based on this, we propose EventRPG, which leverages relevance propagation on the spiking neural network for more efficient augmentation. Our proposed method has been evaluated on several SNN structures, achieving state-of-the-art performance in object recognition tasks including N-Caltech101, CIFAR10-DVS, with accuracies of 85.62% and 85.55%, as well as action recognition task SL-Animals with an accuracy of 91.59%.

Previous efforts on voice conversion focus on factorizing speech into explicitly disentangled representations that separately encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead to information loss by discarding finer nuances such as accent and emotion of the original signal. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective using self-synthesized examples. In this training approach, the current state of the synthesis model is used to generate voice-converted variations of an utterance, which serve as inputs for the reconstruction task, ensuring a continuous and purposeful refinement of the model. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and is applicable to a range of tasks such as zero-shot voice conversion, voice conversion across different languages, and controllable speech synthesis with pitch and pace modifications. We conduct extensive comparisons against prior work and find that SelfVC achieves state-of-the-art results in zero-shot voice conversion on metrics evaluating naturalness, speaker similarity, and intelligibility of synthesized audio.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

To address these problems, this work employs Large Language Models (LLMs) as a decision-making component for complex AD scenarios that require human commonsense understanding. We devise cognitive pathways to enable comprehensive reasoning with LLMs, and develop algorithms for translating LLM decisions into actionable driving commands. Through this approach, LLM decisions are seamlessly integrated with low-level controllers by guided parameter matrix adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method not only consistently surpasses baseline approaches in single-vehicle tasks, but also helps handle complex driving behaviors even multi-vehicle coordination, thanks to the commonsense reasoning capabilities of LLMs. This paper presents an initial step toward leveraging LLMs as effective decision-makers for intricate AD scenarios in terms of safety, efficiency, generalizability, and interoperability.

However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. \nMotivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QP solutions. \nMore precisely, we propose a unified approach which tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible QP solutions in a classical $\\ell_2$ sense. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing QP layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible QPs during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of QP layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. \nAlong with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Optimization problems have uncertain parameters stemming from unknown, context-dependent, distributions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in these problems, one is often interested not only in minimizing expected cost, but also to be robust and protect against worst case scenarios. We propose a novel method that combines the learning stage with knowledge of the downstream optimization task. The method prescribes decisions which aim to maximize the likelihood that the cost is below a (user-controlled) threshold. The key idea is (1) to discretize the feasible region into subsets so that the uncertain objective function can be well approximated deterministically within each subset, and (2) devise a secondary optimization problem to prescribe decisions by integrating the individual approximations determined in step (1). We provide theoretical guarantees bounding the underlying regret of decisions proposed by our method. In addition, experimental results demonstrate that our approach is competitive in terms of average regret and yields more robust solutions than other methods proposed in the literature, including up to 20 times lower worst-case cost on a real-world electricity generation problem.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Since this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have been explored to automate the instruction design process. While these methods demonstrated promising results, they also restricted the output space of the search problem to a demo-free instruction. Such simplification significantly limits their performance, as a single demo-free instruction might not be able to cover the entire problem space of the targeted task due to its complexity. To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm to divide the problem space into homogeneous regions, each governed by a specialized expert. To further improve the coverage of each expert, we expand their prompts to contain both an instruction and several demos.  A two-phase process is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment: Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression, we group demos into clusters based on their semantic similarity and assign a cluster to each expert; (2) instruction assignment: A region-based joint search is applied to optimize an instruction complementary to the demo cluster for each expert, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), outperforms prior art by up to 43% on benchmark NLP tasks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

(2) how to make sure your clustering method is effective in making each cluster homogeneous? (3) how to make sure your generated groups are qualified to support better performance?

In particular, for overparameterized models, the mean and variance networks are powerful enough to either fit every single data point (while shrinking the predicted variances to zero), or to learn a constant prediction with an output variance exactly matching every predicted residual (i.e., explaining the targets as pure noise). This paper studies these difficulties from the perspective of statistical physics. We show that the observed instabilities are not specific to any neural network architecture but are already present in a field theory of an overparameterized conditional Gaussian likelihood model. Under light assumptions, we derive a nonparametric free energy that can be solved numerically. The resulting solutions show excellent qualitative agreement with empirical model fits on real-world data and, in particular, prove the existence of phase transitions, i.e., abrupt, qualitative differences in the behaviors of the regressors upon varying the regularization strengths on the two networks. Our work thus provides a theoretical explanation for the necessity to carefully regularize heteroskedastic regression models. Moreover, the insights from our theory suggest a scheme for optimizing this regularization which is quadratically more efficient than the naive approach.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In the domain adaptation setting where unlabeled target data is available, self-supervised pretraining (e.g., masked autoencoding or contrastive learning) is a promising method to mitigate this performance drop. Pretraining improves OOD error when the generic data augmentations used (e.g., masking or cropping) connect the source and target domains, which may be far apart in the input space. In this paper, we show on real-world tasks that standard fine-tuning after pretraining does not consistently improve OOD error over just supervised learning on labeled source data. To better leverage pretraining for distribution shifts, we propose Connect Later: after pretraining with generic augmentations to learn good representations within the source and target domains, fine-tune with targeted augmentations designed with knowledge of the distribution shift to better connect the domains. Connect Later improves average OOD error over standard fine-tuning and supervised learning with targeted augmentations on 3 real-world datasets: astronomical time-series classification (AstroClassification) by 12%, redshift prediction for astronomical time-series (Redshifts) by 0.03 RMSE (11% relative), and wildlife species identification (iWildCam-WILDS) by 0.9%, achieving the state-of-the-art on AstroClassification and on iWildCam-WILDS with ResNet-50.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

At the same time, self-supervised learning has become very popular, but its performance in the context of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is still unclear.\\n\\nThis paper introduces a new dataset (RedShifts), and contains some encouraging results on two different domains (camera trips and astronomical observations) while performing several relevant ablations (model scale, whether to train the last layer before fine-tuning, strength of pre-training augmentations).\\n\\nThe paper is relatively easy to read, with good writing and a clear structure.\", \"Weaknesses\": \"Overall, I find this paper lacking in a variety of areas:\\n\\nThe authors' refer several times to Shen et al. (2022). This paper argues that contrastive pre-training is beneficial as long as data augmentations ensure that augmented examples must be more likely to change class or domain than changing both. The authors of this manuscript seem to argue in section 3 that the bad results they observe are explained by a violation of this assumption from Shen et al. (2022). However, this isn't tested rigorously (see section 6 of Shen et al., 2022, for examples on how to evaluate connectivity on real world datasets).\\n\\nA second shortcoming is that different self-supervised methods were used for the iWildCam-WILDS dataset (SWaV contrastive learning) and the astronomical time-series (masked autoencoding). This makes it hard to draw conclusions from table 1, since it is unclear which differences can be attributed to the use of different pre-training objectives.\\n\\nThe results on the iWildCam dataset are not very strong (given the means and standard deviations listed, there's a 20% chance that ERM + targeted augs outperforms Connect Later for any run). This leaves the improvements in the astronomical time-series datasets as the stronger proof of Connect Later's performance. But these results are a bit confusing to me: How is it that standard fine-tuning improves in-domain performance (tables 1 and 2)? This suggests to me that these datasets are possibly very small and benefit strongly from the regularization that pre-training provides. In that case, is Connect Later really addressing a domain shift issue? Or is it just addressing a regular overfitting issue? The latter seems plausible given the very small size of the dataset (6,74 objects). I would argue that in order to draw conclusions, the method should be tested on a wider variety of larger datasets.\\n\\nA baseline that seems to be missing as well is the use of general augmentations during fine-tuning (my understanding is that standard fine-tuning uses no augmentations at all). This would clarify whether it is important to use targeted augmentations during fine-tuning, or whether any form of augmentations would be fine.\\n\\nOverall, I find the insights that this paper provides limited: It is not surprising to me that targeted augmentations would help with fine-tuning, given that they were shown to help with regular ERM. The bigger question to me is the one raised in section 3: Why does pre-training not always lead to increased OOD performance? This question remains largely unanswered. I think this paper would be better if it provided, for example, (1) clear evidence that the assumptions from Shen et al. (2022) are routinely violated in real-world datasets and commonly used augmentations, (2) a thorough evaluation of how different pre-training techniques (MAEs, contrastive learning) perform in the UDA setting, or (3) strong evidence that targeted augmentations are particularly important compared to general augmentations.\", \"Questions\": \"See weaknesses.\"}"}]}

Such private information is increasingly being generated in a wide array of distributed contexts by organizations and individuals. Performing such information retrieval using neural embeddings of queries and documents always leaked information about queries and database content unless both were stored locally. We present Private Retrieval Augmented Generation (PRAG), an approach that uses multi-party computation (MPC) to securely transmit queries to a distributed set of servers containing a privately constructed database to return top-k and approximate top-k documents. This is a first-of-its kind approach to dense information retrieval that ensures no server observes a client's query or can see the database content.

In this paper, we propose a novel distance metric called directional distance field (DDF), which computes the difference between the underlying 3D surfaces calibrated and induced by a set of reference points. By associating each reference point with two given point clouds through computing its directional distances to them, the difference in directional distances of an identical reference point characterizes the geometric difference between a typical local region of the two point clouds. Finally, DDF is obtained by averaging the directional distance differences of all reference points. We evaluate DDF on various optimization and unsupervised learning-based tasks, including shape reconstruction, rigid registration, scene flow estimation, and feature representation. Extensive experiments show that DDF achieves significantly higher accuracy under all tasks in a memory and computationally efficient manner, compared with existing metrics. As a generic metric, DDF can unleash the potential of optimization and learning-based frameworks for 3D point cloud processing and analysis.

However, when learning with noisy labels (LNL), they can easily overfit and fail to generalize to new data. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel machine learning method called Learning to Bootstrap (L2B) that leverages a joint reweighting mechanism to train models using their own predictions to bootstrap themselves without being adversely affected by erroneous pseudo-labels. Unlike conventional approaches, L2B dynamically adjusts the importance weight between real observed labels and pseudo-labels, as well as between different samples, to determine the appropriate weighting. Additionally, L2B conducts implicit relabeling concurrently, leading to significant improvements without incurring additional costs. L2B offers several benefits over the baseline methods.  It yields more robust models that are less susceptible to the impact of noisy labels by guiding the bootstrapping procedure more effectively. It better exploits the valuable information contained in corrupted instances by adapting the weights of both instances and labels. Furthermore, L2B is compatible with existing noisy label learning methods and delivers competitive results on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ISIC2019, and Clothing 1M datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the challenges of noisy labels, often necessitating few to no validation samples, and be well generalized to other tasks such as image segmentation. This not only positions it as a robust complement to existing LNL techniques but also underscores its practical applicability.

Solutions to both problems exist, among others, in the form of counterfactual examples generation to enhance explainability or adversarially augment training datasets for improved robustness. However, existing methods exclusively address only one of the issues. We propose a unified framework leveraging image-to-image translation Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to produce counterfactual samples that highlight salient regions for interpretability and act as adversarial samples to augment the dataset for more robustness. This is achieved by combining the classifier and discriminator into a single model that attributes real images to their respective classes and flags generated images as \"fake\". We assess the method's effectiveness by evaluating (i) the produced explainability masks on a semantic segmentation task for concrete cracks and (ii) the model's resilience against the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack on a fruit defects detection problem. Our produced saliency maps are highly descriptive, achieving competitive IoU values compared to classical segmentation models despite being trained exclusively on classification labels. Furthermore, the model exhibits improved robustness to adversarial attacks, and we show how the discriminator's \"fakeness\" level serves as an uncertainty measure of the predictions.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Contrastive self-supervised learning stands out as a powerful technique to learn representations capable of solving a wide range of downstream tasks. However, there have been several challenges that persist.\nFirst, there is no previous work explicitly considering noise, which is one of the critical factors affecting the efficacy of time series tasks.\nSecond, there is a lack of efficient yet lightweight encoder architectures that can learn informative representations robust to various downstream tasks. \nTo fill in these gaps, we initiate a novel sampling strategy that promotes consistent representation learning with the presence of noise in natural time series. In addition, we propose an encoder architecture that utilizes dilated convolution within the Inception block to create a scalable and robust network architecture with a wide receptive field. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting, classification, and abnormality detection tasks, e.g. ranks first over two-thirds of the classification UCR datasets, with only 40% of the parameters compared to the second-best approach.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing works usually compute an unsupervised indicator of a certain model property, such as confidence and invariance, which is correlated with out-of-distribution accuracy. However, these indicators are generally computed based on a \\textit{single} test sample in isolation (and subsequently averaged over the test set), and thus are subject to spurious model responses, such as excessively high or low confidence. To address this issue, we propose to integrate model responses of \\textit{neighboring} test samples into the correctness indicator of the every test sample. Intuitively, if a model consistently demonstrates high correctness scores for nearby samples, it becomes more likely that the target sample will also be correctly predicted, and vice versa. This score is finally averaged across all test samples to indicate model accuracy holistically. This strategy is developed under the vicinal risk formulation, and, since its computation does not rely on labels, is called vicinal risk proxy (VRP). We show that VRP methodologically can be applied to existing generalization indicators such as average confidence and effective invariance and experimentally brings consistent improvements to these baselines. That is, stronger correlation with model accuracy is observed, especially on severe out-of-distribution test sets.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Most existing graph transformers do not take edge direction into account. We therefore introduce a novel graph transformer architecture that explicitly takes into account the edge directionality. To achieve this, we make use of dual encodings to represent both potential roles, i.e., source or target, of each pair of vertices linked by a directed edge. These dual encodings are learned by leveraging the latent adjacency information extracted from a novel directional attention module, localized with $k$-hop neighborhood information. We also study alternative approaches to incorporating directionality into other graph transformers to enhance their performance on directed graph learning tasks. To evaluate the importance of edge direction, we empirically characterize via randomization whether direction really matters for the downstream task. We propose two new directional graph datasets where direction is intrinsically related to learning.
