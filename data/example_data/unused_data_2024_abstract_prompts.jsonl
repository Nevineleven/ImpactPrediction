However, research on proxy robustness remains limited and largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for investigating the robustness of neural network proxies under various sources of optimization pressure in the text domain. Through extensive experiments using our benchmark, we uncover previously unknown properties of the proxy gaming problem and highlight serious issues with proxy reward models currently used to fine-tune or monitor large language models. Furthermore, we explore different approaches to enhance proxy robustness and demonstrate the potential of adversarial training to improve alignment between proxy and gold models. Our findings suggest that proxy robustness is a solvable problem that can be incrementally improved, laying the groundwork for future research in this important area.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Unlike current leading methods, which filter pixels with low-confidence predictions in isolation, our approach leverages the spatial correlation of labels in segmentation maps by grouping neighboring pixels and considering their pseudo-labels collectively. With this contextual information, our method, named S4MC, increases the amount of unlabeled data used during training while maintaining the quality of the pseudo-labels, all with negligible computational overhead. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that S4MC outperforms existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning approaches, offering a promising solution for reducing the cost of acquiring dense annotations. For example, S4MC achieves a  1.29 mIoU improvement over the prior state-of-the-art method on PASCAL VOC 12 with 366 annotated images.

Existing methods are either empirical that cannot certify robustness or suffer from inherent scalability issues. In this work, we study whether randomized smoothing, a scalable certification framework, can be leveraged to certify cost-sensitive robustness. Built upon a notion of cost-sensitive certified radius, we show how to adapt the standard randomized smoothing certification pipeline to produce tight robustness guarantees for any given cost matrix. In addition, with fine-grained certified radius optimization schemes designed for different data subgroups, we propose an algorithm to train smoothed classifiers that are optimized for cost-sensitive robustness.

However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, \\texttt{Wavelet}, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Furthermore, there are many other statements in this paper that do not match reality.**\\n\\n- The writing needs significant improvement. The survey on relevant literature is not comprehensive. \\n\\n- The statement \\\"Traditional methods focus on the ordering of the problem. Little attention has been paid to the response performance, neither on the evaluation metric, nor the modeling\\\" is confusing. In both binary and continuous settings, researchers have recently proposed numerous estimators to predict CATE or ITE, such as Johansson et al. (2016), Shalit et al. (2017), Bica et al. (2019; 2020), Schwab et al. (2020) and Nie et al. (2021).

This statement contradicts my understanding.\\n\\n- The statement \\\"Not to mention that most of the works limit to categorical treatment\\\" is incorrect. Recently, many machine learning IV algorithms have been proposed to identify CATE and are not limited to categorical treatment, such as NPIV, DeepIV, KernelIV, DualIV, FastIV, DFIV, CBIV, AGMM, and DeepGMM.  **The survey on relevant literature is not comprehensive.** \\n\\n- The statement \\\"Most works in causal inference area focus on the binary or discrete treatment case. The continuous treatment case is less studied\\\" is incorrect. Many studies have been conducted on estimating continuous treatment effects, particularly in predicting average dose-response function (ADRF) or average dose-response curve (ADRC) to identify causal effects. Some notable works in this area include (Robins et al., 2000), (Hirano & Imbens, 2004), (Imai et al., 2004), (Flores et al., 2007), (Flores et al., 2012), (Kennedy et al., 2017), (Wilson et al., 2018), (Kallus et al., 2019), (Colangelo et al., 2020), (Sharma et al., 2020), (Klosin, 2021), (Linton & Zhang, 2021), (Zhang et al., 2022), and many others. **The survey on relevant literature is not comprehensive.** \\n\\n- That statement \\\"Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is known as causal inference\\\" is incorrect. Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is not synonymous with causal inference. CATE refers to the average effect of a treatment (intervention) on an outcome under a specific condition. Causal inference, on the other hand, involves analyzing causal relationships to determine the effect of a treatment (intervention) on an outcome of interest. CATE is one method used in causal inference, but they are not identical concepts.\\n\\n- **Algorithm**: The feature X is a common cause of treatment T and outcome Y, which could potentially confound the causal effect of T on Y. Although this paper uses lossdiff to make embedding b independent of treatment T, the embedding factor w may remain confounders of the causal effect of T on Y. How to address the confounding bias from w?\\n\\n- **Experiments**: Due to the incomplete literature review, the paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation and comparison with existing methods, such as GPS (Imbens, 2000; Fong, 2018), DRNet (Schwab et al., 2020), SCIGAN (Bica et al., 2020), VCNet (Nie et al., 2021), making it difficult to assess the practical contribution of the proposed approach.\", \"Questions\": \"See Above.\"}"}]}

Existing literature in CL has mainly focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting. However, they often overlook a critical trade-off between parameter efficiency and capacity saturation. Almost all of the existing approaches including architecture-stable and architecture-growing methods struggle to balance parameter efficiency and capacity saturation. This makes them vulnerable to long-term task-incremental CL under storage constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel CL approach that addresses the trade-off between parameter efficiency and capacity saturation by dynamically expanding the model's weight space in proportion to the actual capacity increase needed by each new task. Specifically, our approach introduces a unique knowledge hypergraph structure that captures the latent knowledge across tasks and leverages it to measure task diversity and estimate the capacity increase required for each new task. Moreover, we introduce new constraints to ensure parameter efficiency during inference and a fine-grained parameter generator to create task-specific sub-networks that ensure a constant number of trainable parameters over time while accommodating the evolving complexities of tasks. Extensive experiment results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark CL datasets, while maintaining low parameter counts.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Replay based CL methods can be understood as having the best parameter efficiency (as the model size does not grow) and tackling the capacity saturation issue with past task samples in the replay buffer. I think more comparisons both in terms of concepts and experiments should be done against replay based CL methods to really justify the proposed trade-off in the paper.\", \"Questions\": \"Please see the weaknesses.\"}"}]}

However, natural language can be ambiguous and images can be over-specified. In this work, we propose hand-drawn sketches as a modality for goal specification in visual imitation learning. Sketches are easy for users to provide on the fly like language, but similar to images they can also help a downstream policy to be spatially-aware and even go beyond images to disambiguate task-relevant from task-irrelevant objects. We present RT-Sketch, a goal-conditioned policy for manipulation that takes a hand-drawn sketch of the desired scene as input, and outputs actions. We train RT-Sketch on a dataset of paired trajectories and corresponding synthetically generated goal sketches. We evaluate this approach on six manipulation skills involving tabletop object rearrangements on an articulated countertop. Experimentally we find that RT-Sketch is able to perform on a similar level to image or language-conditioned agents in straightforward settings, while achieving greater robustness when language goals are ambiguous or visual distractors are present. Additionally, we show that RT-Sketch has the capacity to interpret and act upon sketches with varied levels of specificity, ranging from minimal line drawings to detailed, colored drawings.

This frequency of failure metric is also not well defined, how is this different than failure occurrence?\", \"Questions\": \"Beyond the concerns and questions given in the weakness section.\\n\\n- How many people took the survey?

Previous works adopt feed-forward neural networks to directly regress the variables from sound, leading to poor generalization and domain adaptation issues. In this paper, we illustrate that learning an inverse model of acoustic formation, referred to as disentangled acoustic field (DAF), to capture the sound generation and propagation process, enables the embodied agent to construct a spatial uncertainty map over where the objects may have fallen. We demonstrate that our analysis-by-synthesis framework can jointly infer sound properties by explicitly decomposing and factorizing the latent space of the inverse model. We further show that the spatial uncertainty map can significantly improve the success rate for the localization of fallen objects by proposing multiple plausible exploration locations.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, VAE approaches are known to suffer from poor manifold recovery when the data lie on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a higher dimensional ambient space [Dai and Wipf, 2019]. The consequences of it in drug discovery are somewhat under-explored. In this paper, we explore applying a multi-stage VAE approach, that can improve manifold recovery on a synthetic dataset, to the field of drug discovery. We experimentally evaluate our multi-stage VAE approach using the ChEMBL dataset and demonstrate its ability to improve the property statistics of generated molecules substantially from pre-existing methods without incorporating property predictors into the training pipeline. We further fine-tune our models on two curated and much smaller molecule datasets that target different proteins. Our experiments show an increase in the number of active molecules generated by the multi-stage VAE in comparison to their one-stage equivalent. For each of the two tasks, our baselines include methods that use learned property predictors to incorporate target metrics directly into the training objective and we discuss complications that arise with this methodology.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Sub-population shift accounts for a significant source of algorithmic bias and calls for distributional robustness. Recent studies found inherent distributional robustness in multi-modality foundation models, such as the vision-language model CLIP, yet this robustness is vulnerable through parameter fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose leveraging the connection of robustness among different modalities and reshaping the distributional robustness of one modality with another. Specifically, in the context of the distributional robustness of CLIP, we propose to leverage natural language inputs to debias the image feature representations, to improve worst-case performance on sub-populations. Our extensive empirical studies show that image representations debiased by natural language can achieve significant performance improvement and reduction of performance instability under sub-population shifts.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

To address this gap, we present a novel approach that tackles the challenge of infinite dimensionality in functional classification under LDP constraints. The main idea is to leverage the inherent property of functional data---which allows it to be approximated by a linear combination of basis functions---to reduce the dimensionality of data and facilitate the process of model training under LDP constraints. Specifically, we propose algorithms for constructing functional classifiers designed for both single-server and heterogeneous multi-server environments under LDP. In single-server scenarios, we introduce an innovative allocation strategy where fewer samples are used for training multiple weak classifiers, while the majority are used to evaluate their performance. This enables the construction of a robust classifier with enhanced performance by model averaging. We also introduce a novel technique, ``model reversal\", which effectively enhances the performance of weak classifiers. In multi-server contexts, we employ federated learning and enable each server to benefit from shared knowledge to improve the performance of each server's classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithms significantly boost the performance of functional classifiers under LDP.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Using a learned model of the environment to select actions has many benefits. It can be used to generate experience for learning a policy or simulate potential outcomes in planning. It allows flexible adaptation to new tasks and goals without having to relearn the underlying fundamentals of the environment from scratch. These sample efficiency and generalisation gains from model use are restricted by the model\u2019s accuracy. An imperfect model can lead to failure if trusted by the agent in regions of the state space where predictions are inaccurate. It is well-documented in cognitive and developmental psychology that humans use approximate intuitive models of physics when navigating the world in everyday scenarios. These intuitive models, despite being imperfect, enable humans to reason flexibly about abstract physical concepts (for example, gravity, collisions and friction), and to apply these concepts to solve novel problems without having to relearn them from scratch. In other words, humans efficiently make use of imperfect models. In this paper, we learn dynamics models for intuitive physics tasks using graph neural networks that explicitly incorporate the abstract structure of objects, relations and events in their design. We demonstrate that these learned models can flexibly generalise to unseen tasks and, despite being imperfect, can improve the sample efficiency of policy learning through guiding exploration to useful regions of the state and action space.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Graph convolution in a graph neural network involves aggregating features from neighboring samples to learn representative features for a specific node or sample. On the other hand, Mixup is a data augmentation technique that generates new examples by averaging features and one-hot labels from multiple samples. One commonality between these techniques is their utilization of information from multiple samples to derive feature representation. This study aims to explore whether a connection exists between these two approaches. Our investigation reveals that, under two mild conditions, graph convolution can be viewed as a specialized form of Mixup that is applied during both the training and testing phases. The two conditions are: 1) \\textit{Homophily Relabel} - assigning the target node's label to all its neighbors, and 2) \\textit{Test-Time Mixup} - Mixup the feature during the test time. We establish this equivalence mathematically by demonstrating that graph convolution networks (GCN) and simplified graph convolution (SGC) can be expressed as a form of Mixup. We also empirically verify the equivalence by training an MLP using the two conditions to achieve comparable performance.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

EasyGen handles image-to-text generation by integrating BiDiffuser and an LLM via a simple projection layer. Unlike most existing multimodal models that are limited to generating text responses, EasyGen can also facilitate text-to-image generation by leveraging the LLM to create  textual descriptions, which can be interpreted by BiDiffuser to generate appropriate visual response.

This can be conceptualized as the minimum parameter count needed for effective modeling.\nA sequence of experiments, predominantly centered on text classification, support the ensuing empirical observations regarding the correlation between embedding dimension, layer depth, individual layer ID, and task performance.\nInterestingly, we note that a higher terminal feature ID, when obtained from Transformers, generally correlates with a lower classification error rate. \nThis stands in contrast to the behavior observed in CNNs (and other models) during image classification tasks. Furthermore, our data suggests that the ID for each layer tends to diminish as layer depth increases, with this decline being notably steeper in more intricate architectures.\nWe also present numerical evidence highlighting the geometrical constructs of data representations as interpreted by Transformers, indicating that only nonlinear dimension reduction is achievable.\nLastly, we delve into how varying sequence lengths impact both ID and task performance, confirming the efficacy of data reduction during training.\nOur ambition is for these insights to offer direction in the choice of hyper-parameters and the application of dimension/data reduction when using Transformers for text classification and other prevalent NLP tasks.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Our study includes external knowledge from Wikidata and deviates from the reliance on social information to detect fake news, that many  state-of-the-art (SOTA) fact-checking models adopt. This paper introduces EA$^2$N, an Evidence-based AMR Attention Network for Fake News Detection. EA$^2$N leverages Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) and incorporates knowledge from Wikidata using proposed evidence linking algorithm, pushing the boundaries of fake news detection. The proposed framework encompasses a combination of novel language encoder and graph encoder to detect the fake news. While the language encoder effectively combines transformer encoded textual features with affective lexical features, the graph encoder encodes AMR with evidence through external knowledge, referred as WikiAMR graph. A path-aware graph learning module is designed to capture crucial semantic relationships among entities over evidences. Extensive experiments supports our model's superior performance, surpassing SOTA methodologies. This research not only advances the field of Fake News Detection but also showcases the potential of AMR and external knowledge for robust NLP applications, promising a more trustworthy information landscape.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Here, $e^{amr}$ represents an edge within $\\\\mathcal{G}^{amr}$, and $e^{wiki}$ represents an edge within $\\\\sum_{s, d} \\\\mathcal{P}^{wiki}(v_s^{amr}, v_d^{amr})$.

Simultaneously, $sp^{wiki}\\\\_{s \\\\rightarrow d} = \\\\set {e^{wiki}(v_s^{amr}, n_1), \\\\dots, e^{wiki}(n_k, v_d^{amr})}$ represents the shortest path utilizing only evidence-based connections.\\n- As indicated by Table 2 and Figure 5, a significant portion of entities are linked through evidence-based connections with just one hop, meaning they are connected directly. In other words, for most entity pairs, the shortest path is the \\\"direct\\\" evidence path with a single edge originating from the Wiki graph. This can be represented as $sp_{s \\\\rightarrow d} = sp^{wiki}\\\\_{s \\\\rightarrow d} = \\\\{ e^{wiki}(v_s^{amr}, v_d^{amr})\\\\}$ (Because, as per Table 2, in most cases, the number of edges in $sp^{wiki}\\\\_{s \\\\rightarrow d}$ (being 1 in majority cases), is less than or equal to that in $sp^{amr}_{s \\\\rightarrow d}$.\\n\\nIn essence, this implies that in most cases, when encoding a relationship $r_{s \\\\rightarrow d}$, the relation encoder would **overlook the AMR-based relation information**. While Wikidata relations are valuable, disregarding AMR-level relations may not be technically justified. Therefore, the authors should contemplate how to adapt the relation encoder in the graph transformer to effectively integrate both information sources.\\n\\n**Abstract Meaning Representation**: I have a few major concerns about using an AMR representation here:\\n\\n- The average length of news articles in the Gossipcop dataset is **~600 words** [2] (Some articles are as large as 1000 words). In the case of such large input length, the AMR graphs are going to be \\\"very\\\" noisy. How do the authors handle this case?\\n- The authors don't elaborate on the intuition behind using the Abstract Meaning Representation (\\\"Why specificaly AMR?\\\")? There can be other (more sophisticated) variants of AMR like **AMR-IE** [1] (which uses an AMR guided graph decoder to extract knowledge elements based on the order decided by the hierarchical structures in AMR) which seem more relevant owing to the \\\"integration of external knowledge\\\" used in this work. What about knowledge graphs other than AMR (eg. OpenIE-based approaches [3])?\\n- It seems that the authors have used an off-the-shelf pretrained AMR parser, however they have not provided any details about the same. Was the AMR parser finetuned? (I am guessing not!)\\n\\n**Insufficient Experimentation**: \\n\\n- The presented results are exclusively based on two datasets, Politifact and Gossipcop, both of which are part of the FakeNewsNet database. To ensure the generalizability of the proposed architecture, it is essential for the authors to include results from additional datasets spanning various domains or social media platforms. Moreover, it's worth noting that Politifact, one of the datasets, contains only 815 news articles.\\n- Several of the selected baseline models do not provide a fair basis for comparison. For instance, GCAN [4] incorporates the propagation path of the tweet and user profiles in addition to the source tweet content, features not utilized by the proposed model.\\n- A logistical concern arises from the fact that all the baseline models and their results, including SVM, DTC, RFC, GRU-2, FF, B- TransE, KCNN, GCAN, and KAN, appear to **have been directly borrowed from the FinerFact** [5] paper. Such practices should be avoided, and the authors should explicitly mention the sources of these baseline models in their paper.\\n- In the ablation study examining different variants of the proposed model, such as LM, AMR, LE|AMR, and LE|WikiAMR, the authors should provide significance hypothesis test results (e.g., T-test) alongside the standard deviation of the metrics across multiple runs. Including these statistical measures would enhance the interpretability of the results.\"}"}]}

However, the inherent tension between the objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness presents a significant challenge during LLM training. To address this issue, we propose Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Safe RLHF), a novel algorithm for human value alignment. Safe RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences regarding helpfulness and harmlessness, effectively avoiding the crowd workers' confusion about the tension and allowing us to train separate reward and cost models. We formalize the safety concern of LLMs as an optimization task of maximizing the reward function while satisfying specified cost constraints. Leveraging the Lagrangian method to solve this constrained problem, Safe RLHF dynamically adjusts the balance between the two objectives during fine-tuning. Through a three-round fine-tuning using Safe RLHF, we demonstrate a superior ability to mitigate harmful responses while enhancing model performance compared to existing value-aligned algorithms. Experimentally, we fine-tuned the Alpaca-7B using Safe RLHF and aligned it with collected human preferences, significantly improving its helpfulness and harmlessness according to human evaluations.\n\nCode is available at https://github.com/PKU-Alignment/safe-rlhf.\n\n\nWarning: This paper contains example data that may be offensive or harmful.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The unregulated use of these models, however, can potentially lead to malicious consequences such as plagiarism, generating fake news, spamming, etc. Therefore, reliable detection of AI-generated text can be critical to ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recent works attempt to tackle this problem either using certain model signatures present in the generated text outputs or by applying watermarking techniques that imprint specific patterns onto them. In this paper, we show that these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. In particular, we develop a recursive paraphrasing attack to apply on AI text, which can break a whole range of detectors, including the ones using the watermarking schemes as well as neural network-based detectors, zero-shot classifiers, and retrieval-based detectors. Our experiments include passages around 300 tokens in length, showing the sensitivity of the detectors even in the case of relatively long passages. We also observe that our recursive paraphrasing only degrades text quality slightly, measured via perplexity scores and MTurk human study. Additionally, we show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable against spoofing attacks aimed to mislead detectors to classify human-written text as AI-generated, potentially causing reputational damages to the developers. In particular, we show that an adversary can infer hidden AI text signatures of the LLM outputs without having white-box access to the detection method. Finally, we provide a theoretical connection between the AUROC of the best possible detector and the Total Variation distance between human and AI text distributions that can be used to study the fundamental hardness of the reliable detection problem for advanced language models.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Most DRL methods are based on the \"Learn to Construct\" paradigm, where the trained model(s) can directly generate a set of approximate Pareto optimal solutions. However, these methods still suffer from insufficient proximity and poor diversity towards the true Pareto front. In this paper, we propose \"Learn to Improve\" (L2I), a learning-based improvement method for solving MOCOPs. We embed a weight-related policy network into multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) frameworks to effectively guide the search direction. A shared baseline for proximal policy optimization is presented to reduce variance in model training. A quality enhancement mechanism is designed to further improve the Pareto set in model inference. Computational experiments conducted on two classic MOCOPs, i.e., multiobjective traveling salesman problem and multiobjective vehicle routing problem, indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, our L2I module can be easily integrated into various MOEA frameworks such as NSGA-II, MOEA/D and MOGLS.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Our algorithm contains two types of weight averaging: inter-task weight averaging and intra-task weight averaging. Inter-task weight averaging integrates the ability of previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight averaging enriches the learning of current task by averaging the model parameters within current stage. We also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. BaA seamlessly integrates into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.
