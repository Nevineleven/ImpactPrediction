In recent years, machine learning techniques, especially attention-based models, have become popular for this task due to their ability to model spatio-temporal interactions.\nGap: Existing traffic forecasting models typically handle spatial and temporal dependencies separately, making it difficult to capture the complex, dynamic interactions between different roads over time.\nHypothesis: The Tri-Tense Former (TTformer) model can more accurately capture and represent the spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic data by using three tense-specific attention modules (present-perfect, present, and future), combined with contrastive learning techniques to improve robustness against incomplete data.\nMethod: The method involves designing a new traffic forecasting model, TTformer, which uses three tense-specific attention modules to handle different time aspects of traffic data. The model is based on Graph Attention Networks and uses contrastive learning with a negative filtering technique that does not rely on predefined adjacency matrices. The approach is tested on real traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, comparing its performance to baseline models.\nConclusion: The TTformer significantly outperforms existing models in traffic forecasting tasks, demonstrating greater capability in capturing spatio-temporal relationships and improving robustness against missing data by integrating contextually relevant attention modules and contrastive learning.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, these benchmarks typically evaluate agents only in environments or with partners they were trained with, limiting insights into generalisation capabilities required for real-world applications.\nGap: Current benchmarks fail to assess RL agents' abilities to generalise cooperation with novel partners and in unseen environments, which is crucial for real-world human-AI collaboration scenarios.\nHypothesis: The Overcooked Generalisation Challenge (OGC) is proposed to address this limitation, specifically testing agents' abilities to perform zero-shot cooperation with new partners and in new levels.\nMethod: The OGC employs a cooperative multi-agent RL environment using unsupervised environment design (UED) to create diverse training levels and evaluate agents on five specific unseen Overcooked-AI layouts. It leverages state-of-the-art dual curriculum design (DCD) algorithms and incorporates new components like OvercookedUED and Overcooked Mutator for environment and level design. Various DCD methods such as PAIRED, ACCEL, and PLR are used alongside novel neural network architectures like SoftMoE and S5 LSTM.\nConclusion: State-of-the-art DCD algorithms struggle with the OGC, indicating its complexity. The benchmark underscores the need for improved algorithms for better generalisation and zero-shot cooperation. This challenge highlights the gap in current methodologies and calls for a combined framework for zero-shot coordination and DCD, thus advancing research in human-AI cooperation.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The computational cost of training LLMs for long contexts is high, limiting the practicality of pretraining. Instead, models typically leverage shorter contexts during pretraining and extend their capabilities in later stages, often hampered by a scarcity of high-quality, long-context data. Previous data engineering efforts involved mechanical concatenation of short documents to create long sequences, but this approach does not reliably produce genuine long-distance referral relationships essential for learning.\nGap: The paper addresses the lack of high-quality, natural long-context documents needed for training large language models. Existing methods either concatenate short documents or upsample the relatively long ones, both approaches failing to enrich the data with long-distance referrals, which are crucial for effective long-context training.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that long-distance referrals, which naturally occur in longer documents, are vital for effective long-context training in language models. They suggest that simply concatenating short documents fails to create the necessary complexity and density of these referrals, and they hypothesize that preserving and enhancing referral density through strategic document assembly will improve training efficiency and model performance.\nMethod: The authors introduce LongPack, a data pipeline that constructs long documents by leveraging referral relationships such as hyperlinks in web pages. LongPack extracts these referral signals from web pages, retrieves the contents of these linked pages, and concatenates them to form longer, high-quality documents. This method aims to preserve or enhance the density of long-distance referrals akin to those found in naturally long documents. Their experiments show that LongPack can generate a large corpus of long documents using a minimal number of root documents, scaling up by constructing longer documents enriched with natural referral signals.\nConclusion: The LongPack data pipeline demonstrates that strategic construction of long documents using natural referral signals significantly enhances the quality of training data for long-context language models. This approach improves model performance, achieving a 32.7% higher score than previous methodologies. The paper concludes that the density of long-distance referrals is a critical metric for high-quality long-document construction, providing a scalable solution contributing to more efficient long-context training.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

It involves creating meaningful representations from unlabeled data through constructing positive and negative sample pairs, which typically requires data augmentations. However, generating meaningful data augmentations for tabular data is challenging due to its structured nature. While SSL has shown success in domains like images and text, applying it to tabular data remains difficult. Recent approaches for tabular data have explored improved training procedures, novel architectures, and representation learning techniques. T-JEPA builds on the idea of joint-embedding predictive architectures (JEPA), which focus on mask reconstruction in the latent space instead of the original data space.\nGap: Most self-supervised methods for tabular data rely on data augmentations to generate different views of the same sample, which is challenging and often leads to samples outside the data manifold in structured tabular data. This creates a gap in effectively applying self-supervised learning to tabular data without relying on augmentations.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a novel augmentation-free self-supervised learning method, T-JEPA, can effectively learn rich representations of tabular data by predicting the latent representation of a subset of features from the representation of a different subset within the same sample. This approach should improve performance on downstream classification and regression tasks without requiring data augmentations.\nMethod: T-JEPA employs a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and uses a context encoder to process a masked sample and generate a latent representation. A target encoder processes the same sample without the context mask to generate the target features to be predicted. The method introduces regularization tokens to prevent representation collapse during training. The training objective involves predicting the target mask's latent representation from the context encoder's output and computing the L2 distance between the predicted and actual target representations. Experiments were conducted on various datasets, and several downstream models were trained on T-JEPA's representations to assess performance improvements.\nConclusion: T-JEPA shows significant performance improvements in classification and regression tasks on tabular data over models trained directly on original features and outperforms traditional methods like Gradient Boosted Decision Trees in certain settings. The method effectively identifies relevant features without access to labels, and inclusion of regularization tokens helps avoid representation collapse during training, making augmentation-free self-supervised learning feasible for tabular data.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Few-shot learning, which can operate efficiently with minimal labeled data, is critical in these scenarios. Contrastive learning, which leverages augmentations, has shown promise in improving data representation in various domains, but defining effective augmentations for tabular data, which preserve task-relevant information, remains challenging.\nGap: Current data augmentation methods for tabular data-based contrastive learning struggle to consistently preserve task-relevant information. This is particularly pressing in few-shot learning scenarios where labeled data is minimal. The lack of clear inductive biases in tabular data complicates the creation of augmentations that retain semantic consistency, which is critical for effective contrastive learning.\nHypothesis: Limiting data augmentations to predefined feature-specific ranges based on distributional proximity will better preserve semantic consistency and task-relevant information in tabular data, thus enhancing the performance of few-shot classification tasks.\nMethod: The proposed method involves a range-limited augmentation strategy within a contrastive learning framework. Each feature of the tabular data is divided into a number of predefined ranges based on its distribution. During training, shuffling and sampling are performed within these ranges to create augmented views. The augmentation's selection ratio determines the proportion of features to which this method is applied. This range-limited strategy aims to retain semantic consistency and relevant task information. Evaluation was conducted using FeSTa, a comprehensive benchmark of 42 public tabular datasets, comparing 31 algorithms across different few-shot scenarios.\nConclusion: The range-limited augmentation method significantly outperforms existing tabular learning approaches across various scenarios, achieving a robust improvement in few-shot classification tasks when labeled samples are scarce. This highlights the importance of preserving task-relevant information in augmentations and shows that the method is a simple yet effective strategy for enhancing few-shot learning in tabular domains.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

These deficiencies can lead to inefficient task execution and suboptimal problem-solving outcomes.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a robust agent-oriented planning framework for multi-agent systems, guided by design principles of solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, can significantly improve task decomposition and allocation efficiency. This framework should effectively evaluate intermediate results, allowing timely adjustments for enhanced problem-solving capabilities.\nMethod: The proposed method involves a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems. This framework uses a fast task decomposition and allocation process guided by an LLM-powered meta-agent. A reward model assesses the solvability of sub-tasks without actual agent calls. A detector checks sub-tasks for completeness and non-redundancy, offering optimization suggestions. A feedback loop is integrated to continuously update and improve the meta-agent's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's advancement over baseline methods, showing its effectiveness in solving real-world problems across various datasets.\nConclusion: The proposed agent-oriented planning framework significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of task decompositions in multi-agent systems. It leverages a meta-agent's capacity, a reward model for evaluation, and integrates feedback mechanisms, achieving notable advancements in problem-solving over existing strategies. Such a framework presents a robust method for real-world applications, demonstrating superior performance in empirical evaluations.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, these models are mainly trained on high-resource languages, predominantly English, and their performance significantly degrades when applied to low-resource languages.\nGap: The main gap is the limited applicability of instruction-tuned LLMs for information extraction in low-resource languages due to the lack of labeled data for fine-tuning and limited unlabeled text for pre-training in those languages.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that using English translations of low-resource language data, and combining these with original data (annotation fusion), can improve the performance of cross-lingual instruction-tuned models on information extraction tasks for low-resource languages.\nMethod: This paper introduces TransFusion, a method involving translating low-resource language text to English, annotating this with a high-resource model, and then fusing these annotations with the original text. The final prediction is made using both the translated annotations and original text. The authors developed the GoLLIE-TF model based on this framework and evaluated it using a range of multilingual IE datasets. The training involved annotating English text and projecting these annotations onto low-resource languages using techniques like EasyProject. Various model types were fine-tuned using these annotations, including GPT-4 and encoder-only models.\nConclusion: TransFusion was demonstrated to significantly improve the performance of instruction-tuned LLMs in cross-lingual information extraction tasks. The framework enhances low-resource language NER and adapts well to unseen tasks. It offers a substantial performance boost over existing methods and models, such as GPT-4, using the advantages of machine translation to enrich input data and outperforming trans-train methodologies on low-resource datasets.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, real-world scenarios often violate this assumption due to unobserved variables causing spurious correlations in observed data. Existing methods like FCI use conditional independence to infer causal structures, but they don't provide information about latent relationships and usually assume linearity or deterministic functions of observed variables, limiting applicability.\nGap: Existing causal discovery approaches face limitations with scalability and generalizability for large variable sets, especially in nonlinear contexts where latent variables exist. Prior methods are mostly iterative and cannot efficiently identify causal relations between latent variables unless linear assumptions are made.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a differentiable causal discovery method, utilizing nonlinear latent hierarchical causal models without assuming deterministic relations for latent variables and exogenous noises, can improve the accuracy and scalability of causal structure identification from observational data.\nMethod: The authors establish theoretical identifiability results relaxing previous assumptions about latent variables and exogenous noise, removing the requirement for these to be deterministic. They develop a differentiable causal discovery algorithm that uses the theoretical insights and applies a continuous optimization technique, leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs) with Gumbel-softmax to model structures, while enforcing sparsity and structural constraints through regularization. Experiments are conducted on synthetic data using metrics such as Structural Hamming Distance and F1 scores, and the method is applied to real-world high-dimensional image data (MNIST) to validate performance on transfer learning tasks.\nConclusion: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and scalability. New identifiability conditions for nonlinear latent models are established, increasing applicability to real-world data without deterministic assumptions. The method is successful in learning meaningful hierarchical latent structures from image data, enhancing the understanding and transferability in domain-shift tasks.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The development of 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has similarly progressed, primarily focusing on 3D scene understanding. These models typically incorporate a 3D vision encoder to extract 3D features and align them with a language model to enhance tasks such as robotics, virtual reality, and interior design. However, existing models often focus on holistic scene descriptions, neglecting fine-grained spatial awareness crucial for detailed 3D reasoning and generation tasks.\nGap: Most existing 3D MLLMs rely on capturing holistic scene information or designate specific regions for tasks. They fail to effectively capture multi-level spatial information, which is essential for tasks involving precise 3D location perception and reasoning. These shortcomings limit the models' abilities to perform tasks requiring understanding of spatial relations and exact location generation.\nHypothesis: The Spatial 3D-LLM hypothesis is that by enhancing spatial embeddings of 3D scenes through a progressive spatial awareness scheme, it is possible to achieve superior capabilities in spatial perception and reasoning for 3D vision-language tasks, such as 3D object distance measurement and layout editing.\nMethod: The method involves a new model, Spatial 3D-LLM, which consists of a frozen 3D scene encoder, a language model backbone, and a progressive spatial awareness scheme. This scheme captures and enriches 3D scene embeddings through three stages: intra-referent clustering and abstraction, inter-referent message passing using a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), and contextual interactions involving self and cross-attention layers. This approach enhances spatial reasoning by accumulating spatial knowledge at different levels as part of visual prompts used in end-to-end instruction tuning. Additionally, the model is tested using a newly constructed 3D instruction dataset, MODLE, which includes tasks like 3D object distance measurement and 3D layout editing.\nConclusion: Spatial 3D-LLM improves the state-of-the-art across various 3D vision-language tasks by effectively mining and utilizing enriched spatial information. The results highlight significant gains in spatial perception tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the progressive spatial awareness scheme and the novel dataset in achieving enhanced 3D spatial intelligence.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Previous works in XAI for graphs focused on model-level and instance-level explanations, but less on representation-level explainability.\nGap: There is limited research on explainable graph representation learning. Specifically, it's unclear what specific information about a graph is embedded in its graph representations, which hinders understanding and interpretation of graph data representations.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that examining graph patterns can provide a clear understanding of graph representations. They suggest that graph pattern analysis can lead to more interpretable and explainable graph representations.\nMethod: The authors propose a framework to learn and explain graph representations using graph pattern analysis. They introduce two methods: an unsupervised ensemble graph kernel method and a pattern analysis GNN method. The framework starts by sampling graph substructures, learning their representations, and combining them based on the importance of each pattern's contribution. They provide theoretical analyses on the robustness and generalization ability of the methods. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to demonstrate effectiveness, comparing against several baselines for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.\nConclusion: The proposed methods effectively learn and explain graph representations, outperforming baseline models in both accuracy and interpretability.

Traditional video understanding methods do not suit egocentric videos' unique characteristics, such as constantly changing viewpoints and extensive content linked to daily human activities.\nGap: Current approaches lack comprehensive egocentric video datasets for question-answering (QA) and lack robust models that manage long egocentric videos. Existing methods do not adequately handle the specific challenges in egocentric video training datasets, evaluation benchmarks, or model design.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that building a multimodal foundation model specifically designed for egocentric video understanding can significantly enhance model performance. Introducing a large-scale egocentric QA dataset and a novel model architecture with a specialized evaluation benchmark will advance this area of research.\nMethod: The paper introduces a three-pronged approach: (1) A large-scale dataset creation involving over 7 million QA pairs derived using a 'narration to egocentric QA' strategy from human-annotated video narration. Unlike existing datasets, it focuses on egocentric by mirroring human vision. (2) EgoMemoria, a new benchmark with 629 videos and 7026 questions, is designed to assess models' ability to remember visual details over varying lengths of video content, introducing a de-biasing mechanism to address language bias in evaluation. (3) The MM-Ego model employs a Memory Pointer Prompting mechanism to focus on important frames in a video. It leverages a 'global glimpse' to get an overview and a 'fallback' to detail processing. This tactic improves the processing of long videos efficiently within computational constraints.\nConclusion: The MM-Ego model shows improved performance for understanding egocentric videos, demonstrated by comparisons across benchmarks. The approach effectively overcomes limitations concerning dataset size, benchmark relevance, and computational efficiency.

Traditional analyses of Noisy-SGD assume all internal states are revealed during privacy calculations, which leads to a divergent privacy loss as the number of iterations increases. Previous works by Ye & Shokri (2022) and Altschuler & Talwar (2022) showed that under assumptions of smooth, strongly convex losses, the privacy loss is convergent. However, these assumptions restrict the applicability of their results to broader classes of problems.\nGap: The open question in previous works was whether the assumptions of smoothness and strong convexity could be relaxed while still achieving a convergent privacy loss bound that is more favorable than the standard composition and output perturbation methods, particularly for Noisy-SGD.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that the privacy loss of Noisy-SGD can be convergent even for non-convex, non-smooth losses if the losses have H\\\"older continuous gradients. They further propose that this approach could provide a stricter privacy bound compared to existing methods under certain conditions.\nMethod: The authors extend the shifted R\\'enyi divergence analysis to accommodate non-convex, non-smooth loss functions by using a condition of H\\\"older continuous gradients. Their analysis is based on several technical improvements, such as forward Wasserstein distance tracking and optimal shift allocation. They also introduce the H\\\"older reduction lemma and provide detailed exploration for various mini-batch strategies.\nConclusion: The paper demonstrates that requiring H\\\"older continuous gradients is sufficient for the privacy loss of Noisy-SGD to converge without the need for convexity or smoothness. The proposed method yields a better privacy guarantee than the state-of-the-art for smooth strongly convex losses, and it also provides a convergent privacy loss bound for a wider class of problems.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, the internal workings of these models, particularly how neurons within feed-forward networks (FFNs) function, remain largely opaque and are often seen as a 'black box'. Previous efforts aimed at understanding LLMs have ranged from global analyses, focusing on model behaviors, to detailed examinations of specific components or modules, such as investigating the role of FFNs in producing model outputs.\nGap: There is limited understanding and visibility into the underlying mechanisms of neuron activation within transformer-based LLMs. The predictability and interpretability of neurons within these models have not been explored in depth, which hinders the further optimization and responsible deployment of such powerful tools.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that neuron activations within transformer-based LLMs are predictable. By introducing the Neuron Predictability Lens (NPL), they propose that this predictability can be used to better understand and analyze the role of neurons within feed-forward networks, therefore offering a new perspective on analyzing and interpreting LLMs.\nMethod: The authors develop the Neuron Predictability Lens (NPL), an analytical framework focusing on neuron activation predictability within FFNs. This framework involves mapping FFN neurons' activations across different layers through linear transformations. Experiments were conducted using LLaMA-2 and GPT-J models to evaluate neuron predictability. They trained neuron mappings on subsets of the WikiText2 dataset and assessed predictability using metrics including L2 distance and Pearson Correlation. The NPL framework was applied for both global and local analysis of neuron behavior, assessing global logits contribution and local neuron interpretability.\nConclusion: The study finds that neuron activations within transformer-based LLMs are indeed predictable, highlighting the potential of the NPL framework as a tool for analyzing LLMs. Globally, shallow layers contribute to model behavior more implicitly, while deep layers contribute more explicitly. Locally, neuron predictability correlates with neuron importance, uncovering 'background neurons' that are highly predictive yet critical to model performance. The NPL framework sheds light on its potential applications in enhancing model efficiency and effectiveness in language processing tasks.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

While extensions to video restoration have been attempted, they involve significant computational resources and retraining, limiting their generalizability and practicality, especially across varying degradation types and datasets.\nGap: The application of image restoration diffusion models to video restoration remains largely unexplored, and existing approaches often require extensive retraining, struggling with generalization across different degradation levels and datasets.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that pre-trained image restoration diffusion models can be effectively adapted for zero-shot video restoration by enforcing temporal consistency without additional training or fine-tuning through hierarchical latent warping and hybrid flow-guided spatial-aware token merging.\nMethod: The proposed method involves two key components: hierarchical latent warping and hybrid flow-guided spatial-aware token merging. Hierarchical latent warping provides rough shape guidance by warping between keyframes and within local frames. Hybrid token merging is used to enhance temporal consistency by integrating spatial information, optical flow, and feature-based similarity. By using these mechanisms, the approach achieves temporal consistency in both latent and token spaces without further training, allowing high-quality video restoration. The method is tested on various datasets for video super-resolution and denoising tasks to evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art models.\nConclusion: The method significantly improves temporal consistency and detail generation in video restoration tasks without the need for retraining, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in quality and consistency.

Graph prompt learning is a training paradigm inspired by language and vision model advancements, where GNNs are pre-trained on public data and then adapted to specific tasks using lightweight prompts.\nGap: There is a significant privacy concern with the use of graph prompts tuned on sensitive data. Prior work has shown privacy leakage in language and vision domains, but there has been no exploration in the graph domain. Existing privacy methods like DP-SGD fail to provide effective privacy-utility trade-offs in graph prompt learning due to the limited sensitive data points used.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by leveraging the PATE framework, they can create algorithms (DP-GPL and DP-GPL+W) for differentially private graph prompt learning that ensure high utility while providing strong privacy guarantees.\nMethod: The authors develop two algorithms, DP-GPL and DP-GPL+W, which utilize the PATE framework. These methods employ an ensemble of teacher prompts trained on disjoint subsets of private data, and through a privacy-preserving voting mechanism, knowledge is transferred to a student prompt. DP-GPL+W improves this by weighing teacher votes based on node centrality, intending to enhance privacy-utility trade-offs. The algorithms are evaluated on various graph prompt methods, GNN architectures, and pre-training strategies against datasets including Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed.\nConclusion: The proposed DP-GPL and DP-GPL+W algorithms successfully mitigate privacy risks in graph prompt learning while preserving utility.

The computational and memory efficiency needs optimization due to the large model sizes. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, like LoRA, have emerged by reparameterizing model weights into low-dimensional proxies to reduce computation and memory costs.\nGap: There is a notable performance gap between parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods and full fine-tuning (FT) in achieving accuracy. This gap has not been systematically explored or addressed, and low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA experience a performance plateau as the number of trainable parameters increases.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that Sparse Matrix Tuning (SMT), which selects sparse sub-matrices for fine-tuning, can minimize the performance gap between PEFT and FT methods while reducing computational and memory costs. Unlike LoRA, SMT should not suffer from performance plateau issues as the number of trainable parameters increases.\nMethod: The Sparse Matrix Tuning (SMT) method involves selecting sparse sub-matrices within the model's weights, focusing on those with significant gradient changes during a warm-up phase. The selection uses gradient-based information to identify influential sub-matrices for tuning. The approach includes implementing a customized sparse linear layer to optimize computational efficiency by only calculating necessary gradients. SMT applies sparse sub-matrix updates primarily within the V vector of attention mechanisms, reducing both computation and memory requirements significantly compared to full fine-tuning.\nConclusion: SMT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods (e.g., LoRA and DoRA) by narrowing the performance gap with full fine-tuning and surpassing these methods in accuracy across various tasks. SMT achieves this while reducing the GPU memory footprint and computational costs, showing that attention layers, particularly V vectors, are crucial for downstream task performance.

Recent works have emphasized the importance of incorporating structural information for achieving effective clustering results. Standard methods include DEMVC, which uses collaborative training for learning view representations, and SCMRL, which focuses on multi-view semantic consensus.\nGap: Multiple existing multi-view clustering methods effectively incorporate view-specific structural information but struggle to discover a unified sample-level data partition across different views. The challenge lies in the distinct structural differences between views, leading to difficulties in defining a consistent sample structure that can guide effective clustering across views.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes that constructing a multi-view heterogeneous graph that consists of both sample nodes and view nodes, combined with multi-step random walks, can capture high-order sample structures across various views. This unified sample-level structure will guide more effective clustering by preserving view-specific structures and revealing a comprehensive structure across views.\nMethod: The authors designed a structural multi-view clustering network, SMvCNet, that constructs a heterogeneous graph with sample and view nodes to capture correlations and maintain distinct view structures. A multi-step random walk strategy enables discovery of high-order structures across views. A lightweight network then learns from both within-view and cross-view structures. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness, using metrics like clustering Accuracy (ACC), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and Adjusted Rand Index (ARI).\nConclusion: The proposed SMvCNet effectively utilizes heterogeneous random walks to integrate multi-view information, achieving superior clustering performance compared to existing methods. The method successfully captures both the consistency and complementarity of multi-view data by deriving a unified structure that guides representation learning. The experiments show its substantial potential over recent multi-view clustering models across diverse datasets.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

SVGD uses a particle-based approach to resemble samples from a target probability distribution. However, SVGD suffers from a problem known as variance collapse, especially in high-dimensional spaces, where the algorithm underestimates marginal variances. To address this, several variants and generalizations of SVGD have been developed, focusing on aspects such as factorization of target densities or using different spaces (e.g., Riemannian manifolds).\nGap: The problem addressed in this paper is the variance collapse inherent in SVGD, where the empirical marginals understate variances in high-dimensional settings. Although solutions exist for specific scenarios like factorized target densities, they often imply additional computational costs. The theoretical understanding of the hybrid kernel variant of SVGD (h-SVGD), which aims to solve this without increased computation or factorization constraints, has been limited.\nHypothesis: The hypothesis of the paper is that the hybrid kernel SVGD (h-SVGD) can alleviate the variance collapse challenge of traditional SVGD without incurring additional computational cost and while addressing limitations on target density constraints.\nMethod: The method involves using h-SVGD, which adopts different kernels for the driving and repulsive terms in the SVGD update rule. The theoretical study includes proving the existence of solutions to the hybrid Stein partial differential equation and understanding the h-SVGD as a kernelised Wasserstein gradient flow on a functional different from the traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments were conducted to evaluate h-SVGD in high-dimensional inference tasks, using Gaussian mixtures and Bayesian neural networks, with the performance assessed in terms of variance estimation and computational cost.\nConclusion: The paper concludes that h-SVGD effectively alleviates variance collapse in high-dimensional inference tasks without additional computational cost. Although the fixed point of h-SVGD doesn't match the target distribution in the mean field limit, the practical performance remains competitive. Future work is suggested to further refine kernel scaling techniques and enhance theoretical understanding.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The choice of activation functions for each layer's neurons significantly impacts the performance of INRs. SIREN demonstrated that periodic activation functions are effective in INRs by utilizing fixed sine functions. In contrast, STAF employs periodic activation functions that are dynamically trained with the MLP's weights and biases during the training process, enhancing the network's ability to better capture and reconstruct high-frequency signals. This design is similar to Fourier series, aiming to achieve maximum efficiency with minimal coefficients. As STAF uses layer-wise sharing, each layer shares a unique activation function, allowing the activation behavior to adjust according to the features processed by each layer. This approach aligns well with the hierarchical structure of MLPs. As a result, STAF has shown superior performance across various representations, including images, audio, and shapes.\\n\\n\\n2.

Previous solutions like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) require significant resources and specialized datasets, while prompt engineering often produces inconsistent results.\nGap: There is a need for an efficient and systematic method to ensure LLMs accurately follow user instructions without requiring additional training or extensive computational resources.\nHypothesis: The authors propose GUIDE (Guided Understanding with Instruction-Driven Enhancements), a method to improve the alignment of LLM outputs with user instructions by mechanistically increasing attention scores on instruction tokens using a tagging system. A novel metric called Influence is introduced to measure the propagation and impact of instructions through transformer layers.\nMethod: GUIDE uses tags (e.g., <!-> <-!>) to highlight critical instructions in text, biasing attention scores toward important tokens. The Influence metric quantifies the importance of tokens related to instruction tokens to determine appropriate attention weight increases. The method was evaluated using a HuggingFace-based implementation to generate outputs aligned with specific tasks like summarization and JSON generation, measuring success and alignment with user instructions through experimental setups like the Needle in a Haystack test.\nConclusion: GUIDE significantly improves LLM instruction-following accuracy without additional training, outperforming traditional methods and fine-tuning approaches. The Influence metric effectively predicts the likelihood of instruction adherence, offering a promising tool for Transformer explainability and alignment. GUIDE and Influence are available as open-source tools, showing that systematic attention biasing can enhance LLM performance in instruction-heavy tasks.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

These models function similarly to reinforcement learning (RL) policies but focus on matching a reward or energy distribution rather than reward maximization. Traditional methods for training GFlowNets, like Monte Carlo Markov Chains, can be inefficient due to their computational cost. The training efficiency is also affected by how samples are collected during training, making data sampling crucial for improving GFlowNet training. Previous efforts have attempted to borrow strategies from RL to enhance sampling methodologies used in GFlowNets.\nGap: Current on-policy sampling methods in GFlowNet training face limitations such as poor sample efficiency, failure to explore the environment adequately in low-entropy settings, and a tendency to overfit to recently sampled high-reward trajectories. There is a need for improved sampling techniques to enhance training efficiency and exploration.\nHypothesis: The paper hypothesizes that integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GFlowNet training can lead to more efficient sampling methods that improve the overall training process by leveraging known connections between GFlowNets and maximum-entropy RL.\nMethod: The paper introduces Monte Carlo DAG Search (MCDS), an adaptation of MCTS designed for GFlowNets. MCDS is applied to calculate optimal flows in a GFlowNet environment, using MCTS-like operations tailored to DAG environments. The approach exploits maximum-entropy principles by re-defining reward functions and adjusting the Backup step accordingly. MCDS is used specifically as a sampling tool during GFlowNet training, allowing for off-policy training methods that mix on-policy sampling with distributions from the constructed search DAG. Empirical evaluations are conducted across various discrete environments including hypergrids, Blocksworld tasks, and Factor Graphs to validate the method's effectiveness.\nConclusion: The results show that MCDS improves the data sampling process in GFlowNets, leading to more efficient training compared to conventional on-policy approaches. The method demonstrates superiority across different parameterizations and training objectives by better navigating the exploration-exploitation trade-off. This approach establishes a foundation for future adaptations of classical planning algorithms to GFlowNet scenarios.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, in animation, large datasets are often unavailable, and existing methods using GANs or diffusion models struggle with expressiveness and diversity. Recent advances have focused on efficient embeddings and explicit distribution modeling using generative masked transformers, but these require large datasets and tend to overfit when applied to single or few sequences.\nGap: Current methods in motion synthesis, particularly when large datasets are unavailable, face challenges such as overfitting and poor diversity in generated results. Existing generative masked models tend to collapse when applied to single or few sequences, and GANs or diffusion models either lack expressiveness or produce unnatural synthesis.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes that using a localized generative masked transformer with sliding window local attention and novel quantization techniques can better capture and generate diverse motion patterns from a single motion reference, overcoming overfitting and expressiveness limitations in existing methods.\nMethod: MotionDreamer, a localized masked modeling paradigm, learns motion patterns from a single reference by embedding motion into quantized tokens using a novel distribution regularization method, constructing a robust codebook. The model incorporates sliding window local attention to capture local dependencies and overlaps, enabling the generation of diverse and natural animations. A formal evaluation framework was established using metrics like coverage, diversity, and perceptual assessments on a dataset containing both human and animal motions.\nConclusion: MotionDreamer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in faithfully preserving and diversifying motion patterns from a single reference.

SinMDM introduces QnA layers that allow local attention with a temporally narrow receptive field. And MotionDreamer incorporates sliding window local attention to achieve this. Besides, another key design of codebook distribution regularization has been explored in single image synthesis domain. Therefore, I think the technical contribution of the paper is somewhat limited.\\n\\n-  In Ablation Studies (Sec. 4.4), it's better to use QnA layers in SinMDM to replace sliding window local attention and show the comparison of the performance.

However, despite their ability to handle extensive inputs, these models struggle with generating outputs longer than 2,000 words. This limitation is problematic given that a noticeable percentage of user prompts require outputs exceeding this length.\nGap: Current long-context LLMs are limited to generating outputs of approximately 2,000 words due to the scarcity of longer samples in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets. Most SFT datasets lack examples with output lengths beyond this point, which caps the models' generation capabilities despite their longer input handling during pre-training.\nHypothesis: The generation length of LLMs can be extended beyond current limits by providing them with SFT data containing longer outputs. By expanding the dataset to include longer outputs, models can generate coherent outputs that extend to over 10,000 words or more.\nMethod: The authors introduce AgentWrite, a novel agent-based pipeline that deconstructs ultra-long generation tasks into subtasks. This allows existing LLMs to produce coherent outputs exceeding 20,000 words. Using AgentWrite, they create LongWriter-6k, a dataset comprising 6,000 entries ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 words. They also develop LongBench-Write, a benchmark for evaluating ultra-long generation capabilities. Models are trained using LongWriter-6k, and further improvements are achieved using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\nConclusion: The introduction of extended SFT data through LongWriter-6k allows models to scale their output length to over 10,000 words while maintaining output quality. The use of AgentWrite and DPO enables the models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in long-text generation, demonstrating that LLMs have an untapped potential for larger output windows when provided with sufficient training data.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, this improvement incurs significant computational costs, challenging the efficiency and scalability of these models. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture presents a potential solution, allowing for large model scaling without a proportional rise in computational effort by sparsely activating only a few expert networks per input, managed by a routing strategy. Top-K routing has been the dominant approach in MoE models, selecting a fixed number of experts for each token.\nGap: The key limitation of traditional Top-K routing is its static nature, which does not account for the varying complexity and importance of different tokens in a sequence. This static approach can result in inefficient resource allocation, where simple tokens may receive more computational resources than necessary, while complex tokens may not receive enough attention, thus hindering model performance and efficiency gains.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a dynamic routing strategy, which adjusts the number of activated experts for each token based on its contextual importance, could achieve better computational efficiency and model performance compared to the traditional static Top-K routing strategy.\nMethod: The authors introduce Ada-K routing, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts per token. This method incorporates lightweight, pluggable allocator modules that learn to allocate expert resources based on the context of each token. These allocators are trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, allowing them to operate within the non-differentiable sampling framework. Extensive evaluations were conducted using four MoE-based LLMs varying from 14.3B to 140B parameters. Results were compared to models implementing Top-K routing by assessing accuracy, floating point operations (FLOPs), and inference speed across six benchmarks.\nConclusion: Ada-K routing consistently outperformed baseline models using Top-K routing, reducing expert activation by 30% to 40%, lowering FLOPs by over 25%, and providing more than a 20% inference speedup while enhancing model performance across multiple benchmarks. The method is efficiently trainable, requires minimal additional parameters, and maintains expert load balance. It provides insights into adaptive resource allocation by adjusting expert activations based on token complexity and task difficulty, significantly enhancing the efficiency of MoE-based LLMs.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Communication is a major bottleneck due to its cost and slowness, often executed over unreliable networks. Two main strategies to improve communication efficiency in FL are Local Training (reducing communication frequency) and Communication Compression (using compressed data instead of full vectors).\nGap: Existing methods often struggle to effectively combine Local Training (LT) and Communication Compression (CC) while achieving accelerated communication efficiency. Single methods generally either apply LT or CC without fully leveraging the benefits of both simultaneously.\nHypothesis: LoCoDL can combine Local Training and Communication Compression effectively with any compressors from the general class of unbiased compressors, U(\u03c9), to achieve a doubly-accelerated communication complexity, significantly improving efficiency beyond existing algorithms.\nMethod: LoCoDL employs a randomized primal-dual approach with local model estimates stored and updated by clients. The algorithm exchanges compressed differences between model estimates and utilizes a probabilistic communication schedule. It uses unbiased compressors from the class U(\u03c9) and involves regular updates of local model and dual variables to maintain dual feasibility. Finally, a comprehensive mathematical framework ensures linear convergence, with theoretical proofs showing dependability on the model and data distribution characteristics.\nConclusion: LoCoDL successfully integrates Local Training and Communication Compression, achieving a doubly-accelerated communication complexity that surpasses existing algorithms in federated learning in terms of practical performance. The algorithm is particularly suited for diverse data distributions, maintaining high efficiency across different regimes, thereby setting new standards for communication-efficient distributed learning.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, the specific roles of different architectural elements within transformers and their interplay in shaping the model's hypothesis space remain poorly understood.\nGap: The explicit contribution and interaction of transformer components, specifically the token-mixing attention and feed-forward layers, to the range of algorithms that transformers can learn in a controlled task like counting are not fully understood. There is a lack of clarity on how these elements interact to influence model solutions, particularly in simple tasks requiring counting.\nHypothesis: The hypothesis is that subtle changes in transformer architecture, such as the inclusion of softmax in the attention mechanism, can significantly influence the model's ability to implement different counting strategies (relation-based and inventory-based) depending on the synergy among hyperparameters and components.\nMethod: The study analyzed transformer architectures with one-layer models alternating a token-mixing mechanism and a feed-forward network on the histogram task, which involves counting the occurrences of each token in an input sequence. They examined four token mixing models (lin and dot, both with and without softmax) and evaluated their performance concerning embedding dimension and hidden layer size. Theoretical constructions were developed to demonstrate how different strategies can implement counting tasks with specific configurations. Experiments were conducted using a generated dataset representing discrete input sequences to validate these theoretical insights.\nConclusion: The study concluded that two main types of counting strategies can be theoretically implemented: relation-based, which uses pair-wise comparisons within sequences, and inventory-based, which relies on memorizing token occurrences. It was found that even minor architectural changes significantly influence a transformer\u2019s ability to learn these strategies. Embedding dimension and hidden layer size play crucial roles, requiring careful alignment for optimal performance. The softmax function can either benefit or hinder performance, depending on its use and model architecture.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Quantization methods are used to reduce these costs and improve speed. Specifically, quantization is critical for low-bit inference like INT4. However, these methods often face challenges due to activation outliers that hinder effective quantization by stretching the quantization range and compressing effective bit usage for normal values.\nGap: Existing solutions to manage activation outliers often lead to either high latency or accuracy degradation in low-bit (INT4) quantization due to their inefficiency in handling outliers effectively. Common methods like separating outliers into different matrices or migrating them from activations to weights do not resolve the accuracy drop for weight-activation quantization at 4 bits.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a novel method combining runtime smoothing and rotation, termed as Rotated Runtime Smooth (RRS), can efficiently manage and reduce the impact of activation outliers in low-bit quantization, improving the accuracy of INT4 inference without incurring significant computational overhead.\nMethod: The method involves two core components: Runtime Smooth (RS) and the Rotation operation. RS is designed to eliminate channel-wise outliers by smoothing the activations during runtime. The Rotation operation is applied to address spike outliers by spreading them across their tokens, making them more consistent and less likely to cause errors post-smoothing. The RRS method involves rotating weights and activations, applying runtime smoothing, quantizing the smoothed activations, and integrating these into a fused GEMM kernel, all while ensuring compatibility with existing hardware and minimizing additional computational costs.\nConclusion: Rotated Runtime Smooth (RRS) significantly enhances INT4 inference accuracy by addressing both channel-wise and spike outliers effectively. This method achieves a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art approaches such as SmoothQuant and QuaRot by offering improved perplexity scores on LLaMA and Qwen models. RRS also demonstrates general applicability and low overhead, making it suitable for current hardware setups and facilitating advancements in efficient low-bit large language model inference.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditional methods require extensive dense annotations which are expensive and impractical in medical domains, especially for videos. Existing few-shot approaches generally focus on learning from limited examples using prototype learning or matching-based approaches. Additionally, recent methods attempt cross-domain adaptation and domain generalization for dealing with the distribution shift between training and test datasets.\nGap: There is a lack of efficient methods for segmenting objects in medical videos using minimal annotations such as a ground truth mask only for the first video frame. This gap is pronounced due to the scarcity and high cost of annotated medical video datasets needed for training robust segmentation models.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a framework trained on static image datasets can be adapted to medical videos through a novel test-time training strategy that uses a memory mechanism and self-distillation, allowing for effective one-shot segmentation in medical videos with minimal additional annotations.\nMethod: The authors' method involves training a one-shot segmentation model on static images and adapting it to video content through test-time training. This involves duplicating the pre-trained model and adding a memory mechanism that takes advantage of long-term spatiotemporal context, enabling improved frame-by-frame segmentation. The model adapts during testing using self-distillation to ensure it retains generalization capabilities from the training data while adapting to the temporal characteristics of video data. The authors introduce a memory bank where key-value pairs from the initial frame and uniformly selected frames guide segmentation, and self-distillation aligns features and outputs with the original model. An OS-I2V-Seg dataset is constructed to evaluate and establish baselines for this task.\nConclusion: The proposed approach effectively segments medical videos with minimal data using static image datasets, outperforming alternative few-shot and cross-domain methods in low-data settings. The method demonstrates that leveraging static image data with a memory-based test-time adaptation framework can bridge the gap to video segmentation where annotated data is scarce.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This necessitates effective methods to evaluate the diversity of LLM-generated datasets.\nGap: The diversity evaluation of datasets generated by LLMs is under-explored. Current methods from NLP and ML are not completely suitable for this task due to their limitations, such as a focus on form rather than semantic diversity, reliance on external references, and computational complexity.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes a new method, DCScore, to evaluate the diversity of LLM-generated datasets from a classification perspective. The hypothesis is that by treating diversity evaluation as a sample classification task, DCScore can effectively assess diversity while reducing computational costs and integrating existing methods.\nMethod: DCScore evaluates the diversity by treating it as a classification task for the samples in the dataset. This involves calculating a kernel matrix representing similarities between samples and then utilizing a classification function to compute diversity scores as the trace of a classification probability matrix. The method satisfies several diversity-related axioms and is compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness by correlating its scores against several diversity pseudo-truths like generation temperature and human judgment.\nConclusion: DCScore is an effective diversity evaluation method for LLM-generated datasets.

However, their deployment faces challenges due to high computational costs and energy demands, motivating research into model pruning for size reduction while maintaining performance.\nGap: Existing pruning methods often focus on fixed pre-trained models and overlook the impact of weight perturbations, which can originate from sources like quantization errors or precision format changes. These perturbations make traditional few-shot gradient pruning techniques fragile and susceptible to variations in the model weights, leading to inconsistent pruning outcomes.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that using the Moreau envelope to estimate the importance of model weights can provide robustness against weight perturbations, leading to more stable and effective pruning outcomes in LLMs.\nMethod: The proposed method, MoreauPruner, utilizes the gradient of the neural network's Moreau envelope to estimate weight importance robustly. It incorporates \u21131-group-norm-based regularization to induce sparsity and is evaluated on models like LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA3-8B, and Vicuna-7B. The approach involves using a proximal gradient descent algorithm to optimize the Moreau envelope's gradient and includes a post-pruning fine-tuning phase with LoRA to recover model performance.\nConclusion: The results demonstrate that MoreauPruner provides robust pruning outcomes against weight perturbations, maintaining model performance more consistently than other pruning methods. The experiments show its effectiveness in maintaining accuracy post-pruning on several well-known LLMs, highlighting more stable pruning outcomes between different weight formats (bfloat16 and float16) and improved zero-shot performance.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In particular, I am even not sure why the inconsistency of the pruning outcomes up to small perturbation is problematic. There can be many different but equally good pruning masks for a neural network. Indeed, the classic structured pruning work by Srinivas and Babu (2015) proposes to remove either neuron A or neuron B (but not both) whenever two neurons are highly similar to each other, as they are considered redundant. Here, we should be indifferent to the choice whether we remove neuron A or neuron B; both gives us a reasonable good choice. If the authors believe that there should be a unique choice of pruning masks, I recommend giving more supporting evidences, e.g., empirical backups.\\n\\n- Also, it is not clear to me why the results in Table 1 is meaningful. If I understood correctly, it seems like the authors are trying to prove that MoreauPruner a more robust performance on both BF16 and FP16. Here, I am not sure why the \\\"Diff\\\" matters. Perhaps the fact that MoreauPruner achieves smaller perplexity on both cases is what is meaningful, and having a small \\\"diff\\\" may not really have much implications, as working bad on both numeric types can result in small diff as well. Also, I am curious why MoreauPruner seems to consistently work poorer than LLM-Pruner for 5% pruning ratio.\\n\\n- The performance gain over LLM-Pruner is not very dramatic, which I believe is perhaps linked to the unclear motivation.\\n\\n- The set of target models is somewhat restricted, as they are constrained to LLaMA family, except for Vicuna-7B. I recommend adding (at least two) experiments on other options, such as Mistral, Qwen, OPT, or BLOOM.\\n\\n- I am not sure if I missed, but it would be great if authors could make any remarks on the computational costs of obtaining the pruning masks, such as required memory and computations.\\n\\n- The quality of writing can be improved. For instance, the paper uses the terminology \\\"structural pruning,\\\" which I believe should be replaced with much more popular term \\\"structured pruning\\\" (I am aware that the term \\\"structural pruning\\\" has been used in some recent works, but I think they are mostly mistakes). Also, \\\"anti-intuitive\\\" can be replaced by \\\"counterintuitive.\\\" The phrase \\\"robustness pruning result\\\" in L77 is weird. In L165, \\\"easy obtained\\\" should be \\\"easily obtained.\\\" In L181, \\\"effiently\\\" should be \\\"efficiently.\\\" In L230, \\\"envelop\\\" should be \\\"envelope,\\\" as in all other usages. In figure 4 caption, \\\"hyper-paramter\\\" is wrong. There should be much more errors; please locate them and fix them all.\", \"Questions\": \"- A mild suggestion is to draw motivation for perturbation robustness from other sources of weight perturbation. For example, here are some half-baked thoughts: (1) Pruning itself perturbs the weights; that is, pruning some weights may affect gradient evaluations for other weights. (2) Further re-training with LoRA may also be the source of expected weight perturbation; the proposed method can be viewed as being ready for such updates.\"}"}]}

ImageNet-C has been used to test out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness by applying common corruptions to ImageNet data. However, with web-scale data like LAION, which inherently contains many of these corruptions, ImageNet-C is no longer truly OOD for these models.\nGap: Current OOD benchmarks like ImageNet-C are inadequate for evaluating the robustness of contemporary models trained on large web-scale datasets because they already contain similar corruptions, reducing the OOD nature of these benchmarks.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by creating a new benchmark, LAION-C, which includes distortions genuinely OOD for web-scale datasets, it's possible to better challenge and evaluate the robustness and generalization capabilities of modern vision models.\nMethod: The LAION-C dataset includes six synthetic distortion types applied to images from the ImageNet validation set, each with five intensity levels. The distortions are designed to disrupt visual consistency and perceptual cues, like Mosaic, Glitched, and more. The authors evaluated 58 vision models using LAION-C and conducted psychophysical experiments with human participants to compare their performance.\nConclusion: LAION-C presents a more robust evaluation challenge than ImageNet-C, as shown by the significant drop in model performance on LAION-C compared to ImageNet-C. The findings suggest that modern models, despite their superior performance, are using diverse strategies distinct from human-like strategies.

Recently, the feature propagation mechanisms of GNNs have been compared to diffusion processes, a perspective that views them as dynamical systems. These analogies have drawn interest towards using dynamical systems theory, particularly Koopman theory and Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), to understand GNN behavior better.\nGap: While there are established connections between GNN feature propagation and diffusion processes, there exists a gap in exploring these dynamics from a physical or system dynamics lens, especially one that rigorously applies modern dynamical systems theories like Koopman theory to assess GNN performance and behavior.\nHypothesis: By integrating Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it is possible to estimate a reduced order model that captures complex graph dynamics efficiently and effectively. This integration could enhance GNN performance across various graph learning tasks by providing a sound theoretical basis and data-driven insights via the calculation of low-rank linear operators.\nMethod: The authors introduce a framework called DMD-GNN, where they utilize DMD to estimate a low-rank, finite-dimensional linear operator from multiple state observations of the system. This approximation captures potential nonlinear interactions between graph nodes. Specific DMD-GNN models are developed, which leverage the low-rank eigenfunctions provided by DMD for effective feature propagation. The approach also allows for incorporating domain-specific constraints like symmetry to reflect known physical properties of the systems involved. The method is validated with experiments on tasks including directed graphs, large-scale graphs, long-range interactions, spatial-temporal graphs, and link prediction.\nConclusion: The integration of DMD into GNNs, as proposed by this work, leads to models that deliver state-of-the-art performance across several standard graph-based learning tasks. The DMD-enhanced GNN models are verified experimentally to offer improved accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the practical benefits of viewing GNN feature propagation through the lens of dynamical systems and using DMD to refine this understanding.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Koh and Liang (2017) introduced Hessian-based influence functions to approximate the effect of removing one training point. However, existing methods for calculating influence functions, particularly using inverse Hessian-vector products (iHVP), involve computationally expensive algorithms like LiSSA, which suffer from high computational cost and require delicate hyperparameter tuning.\nGap: The primary limitations with current methods for calculating inverse Hessian-vector products using LiSSA are the computational cost and the complexity of hyperparameter tuning, which make them impractical for large models.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes that the three hyperparameters of the LiSSA algorithm\u2014scaling factor, batch size, and number of steps\u2014can be effectively set using two specific spectral properties of the Hessian: its trace and largest eigenvalue, which can be evaluated using random sketching techniques.\nMethod: The authors use the Gauss-Newton Hessian and random sketching techniques to determine the trace and largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, allowing them to set the hyperparameters for LiSSA. They then empirically validate these settings across different models, including ResNet and language models, and compare their approach to Proximal Bregman Retraining Functions (PBRF), which serve as the ground truth.\nConclusion: The paper concludes that by using spectral properties of the Hessian, the authors can set hyperparameters for the LiSSA algorithm that allow it to be practically applied to large models. This approach makes influence function calculations more feasible and reliable, and can serve as a baseline for validating other influence function estimation methods.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditionally, OTC markets, where a broker suggests trading prices based on an asset without strict protocols, have been explored. However, incorporating rich contextual data into this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.\nGap: The existing literature on online learning for bilateral trade has not explored the contextual version of the problem. This is significant as brokers often have access to meaningful contextual information about the assets being traded and the market conditions, which can enhance trading decision accuracy.\nHypothesis: Incorporating contextual information allows a broker to propose more accurate trading prices, potentially maximizing the expected gain from trade by leveraging a linear relationship between market value and observed context.\nMethod: The study uses an online learning setup where the broker sets trading prices for an asset based on a $d$-dimensional contextual information vector. It models traders' valuations as independent, zero-mean perturbations of the asset's market value. Two types of feedback mechanisms are considered: full feedback, where traders\u2019 valuations are revealed, and two-bit feedback, where only traders' willingness to trade at suggested prices is known. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on 'regret' with respect to 'gain from trade'. The algorithm is constructed to be optimal under these feedback conditions, using ridge regression for full feedback and a scouting ridge regression approach for two-bit feedback.\nConclusion: The results show that when the traders' valuations are perturbed by zero-mean noise with bounded density, the proposed algorithms in both the full and two-bit feedback settings achieve optimal regret bounds. The paper concludes that without the bounded density assumption, the brokerage problem becomes unlearnable, establishing the necessity of this assumption for successful learning in this context.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

It is clear that a trade happens if the proposed price $p_t \\\\in [s_t, b_t]$. In this paper, however, the role of the buyer and seller are not determined. Two parties arrive, and depending on the p_t given, either could be a buyer or seller. This is quite strange and only really makes sense if both traders own the underlying asset - so either can be the seller. I am not sure how to justify this/be on board with this model and realistic this is in OTC markets.\\n\\n- In this model, both trader's valuation arise from a stochastic process, which in expectation, is equal to the market price, which is crucially consistent with the context observed by the learner. So $E[V_t] = E[W_t] = m_t = \\\\langle c_t, \\\\phi \\\\rangle$. This is also quite a strange and strong assumption; this notion of an expected ground truth market price agreed both buyer and seller parties is not present in (Cesa-Bianchi, 2021). In general, market price arises endogenously due to trading between different parties with possibly heterogenous expected valuations. Am I correct to say that if both traders are highly concentrated (low variance), then the GFT should be very small since they both have the same EV? Moreover, it requires consistency with the learner's context. On theoretical models, I am happy to be lenient with assumptions, but I worry that in this case, it does not provide any more natural insights or technical benefits over what is currently proposed in the literature (see below):\\n\\n- I am trying to understand the novelty or additional insight this paper provides over \\\"An Online Learning Theory of Brokerage\\\" (Bolic, 2024), which the authors cite. That paper does not make a contextual assumption, nor do they make an assumption about mean of the trader's distribution - however, they assume both traders valuations are from same fixed distribution. In this model, trader's don't need to have the same distribution, but the same mean, which is consistent with the market price the context reveals. Beyond these differences, the model is nearly identical and the bounds achieved are also identical. I am not sure if the different distributional assumption can truly be justified as loosening the model since it requires an additional sort of internal consistency with the context - $E[V_t] = E[W_t] = m_t = \\\\langle c_t, \\\\phi \\\\rangle$. I understand why this assumption is made from a technical/learning perspective, but conceptually, I don't see any immediate reasons to think this model is more natural than the one in (Bolic, 2024) or (Cesa Bianchi, 2021) which clearly delineates buyers and sellers, both of which give similar bounds. \\n\\n- Why use this strange notation for $a \\\\wedge b$ denoting $min(a, b)$ and $a \\\\vee b$ denoting $max(a,b)$?

However, efficiently deploying SSMs on cloud and edge hardware remains a challenge.\nGap: Traditional quantization techniques designed for Transformers do not work well for SSMs due to their unique activation patterns, including highly sensitive feature maps and significant outliers in output activations.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a tailored quantization method, specifically a static 8-bit per-tensor quantization approach including suppressing outliers in activations with the Hadamard transform, can effectively reduce SSM model size and improve deployment efficiency without significant accuracy loss.\nMethod: The paper introduces Quamba, an 8-bit per-tensor quantization method. It manages outliers by employing the Hadamard transform to the output activations and uses percentile clipping for input activations, optimizing the quantization precision. Experiments involve applying this technique to the Mamba 2.8B SSM and evaluating on zero-shot tasks, showing reduced model latency and slightly lower accuracy on edge and cloud platforms.\nConclusion: Quamba successfully reduces the memory footprint and latency of SSMs like Mamba and Jamba while maintaining competitive accuracy. This demonstrates that SSMs can be efficiently quantized and deployed on both cloud and edge platforms, addressing deployment challenges for large language models.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, there are several critical questions that I raised in the \\\"Question\\\" section, which I believe are essential for the clarity and robustness of the findings. I hope the authors can provide insights on these points, and I look forward to further discussion.\", \"Questions\": \"1. As a researcher focused on large model quantization on edge devices, I have some concerns about the authors' claim regarding the lack of prominent outliers in transformers. Based on my own experiments and findings [1-2] from recent literature, larger language models (LLMs) actually tend to exhibit more significant outliers, especially in channel-wise activation. Can you clarify your claim about outliers in Transformers and provide evidence or citations supporting your view?\\n\\n2. Studies [3-4] on transformer quantization have shown that quantizing outliers can substantially impact model accuracy. This observation aligns with the authors' ablation study results. However, I am unclear on why certain techniques in this paper appear to alleviate the impact of outlier quantization. Additionally, shouldn\u2019t each optimization step incrementally reduce accuracy? Surprisingly, the authors' ablation study shows an improvement in accuracy when all three techniques are applied together. Could you please provide a more detailed explanation of why your techniques, when combined, lead to improved accuracy rather than incremental reductions?\\n\\n3. In the introduction, the authors mention that this quantization method is applicable to both edge devices and cloud computing. However, the experiments only feature the high-compute edge device Orin Nano 8G (and the A5000, which would generally not be considered an edge device). There is no testing on cloud computing hardware, which would have been helpful.\\n\\n4. For the results in Table 1: Profiling Latency, I find some inconsistencies. As token length increases, both computation and memory should scale linearly, so I would expect a relatively stable speedup ratio. If anything, given the execution overhead of the nonlinear kernel within SSM, there might be a slight increase in latency with token length. However, the authors' data show an unusual spike in performance at $L=512$ and $L=1$. Could you please provide a more detailed explanation of the observed performance spikes, possibly including additional data points or experiments that could help clarify the relationship between token length and speedup ratio?\\n\\n5. Lastly, could the authors clarify how many hardware measurements were conducted to obtain the reported results? Given the inherent variability in hardware performance, multiple measurements are typically necessary to ensure stability and reliability. It would be helpful to understand the stability of the hardware results presented. Could you please provide details on the number of runs performed for each experiment, any measures taken to account for variability (e.g., averaging results, reporting standard deviations), and how you ensured the stability and reproducibility of your hardware measurements?\\n\\n[1] Shen, Xuan, et al. \\\"Agile-Quant: Activation-Guided Quantization for Faster Inference of LLMs on the Edge.\\\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

Multi-label node classification (MLNC) on graphs is an important task because many nodes naturally have multiple labels due to diverse functions or interests, such as proteins in PPI networks or users in social networks. Existing methods typically leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) or label embeddings to leverage label co-occurrence or proximity but do not address the intricate influences between labels in non-Euclidean spaces.\nGap: Current MLNC approaches often fail to fully exploit the complex label correlations present in graph data. They typically only consider label proximity and co-occurrence correlations, overlooking how different labels might enhance or hinder each other's performance when they interact over non-Euclidean graph structures.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that decomposing the message passing process in GNNs into propagation and transformation operations and analyzing these separately will allow for better quantification and modeling of label influence correlations. This approach can better capture complex inter-label influences, thereby improving MLNC performance.\nMethod: The proposed method involves decomposing GNN message passing into propagation and transformation operations to analyze label influence correlations. A label influence propagation model, named Label Influence Propagation (LIP), is introduced. It constructs a label influence graph and propagates high-order influences through it, adjusting the learning process dynamically by amplifying or mitigating label influences. The approach is validated using benchmark datasets, demonstrating it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nConclusion: The proposed LIP framework demonstrates superior performance in MLNC tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. By capturing high-order label influence correlations, it improves classification accuracy, as evidenced by consistent improvements across multiple datasets. This method also effectively quantifies and utilizes label influences to enhance learning, highlighting its utility in complex graph-based applications.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This offers improved accuracy and interpretability. The evolution of neural networks has been significant since the 1990s, but many issues related to their 'black box' nature, interpretability, and adaptability remain.\nGap: Despite advancements in neural networks, there remains a lack of flexibility and robustness in adapting to data variability, especially in the face of noise and irregular data distributions. Existing KANs often maintain fixed forms and have not been systematically adapted to enhance flexibility while balancing performance in diverse datasets.\nHypothesis: The hypothesis is that by utilizing a variable function basis within the KAN framework, specifically using Bernstein polynomials, the model can gain improved flexibility and robustness while minimizing the influence of variable input data on performance.\nMethod: The paper proposes a generalized framework for KANs that employs a Variety Bernstein Polynomial Function Basis (VBn-KAN). This method leverages the Weierstrass approximation theorem by incorporating Bernstein polynomials to ensure robustness through uniform convergence. The paper utilizes Bayesian optimization to dynamically adapt the polynomial degree according to the dataset characteristics, thereby balancing approximation accuracy and resource constraints. Experiments were conducted across three fields: multivariate time series forecasting, computer vision, and function approximation.\nConclusion: The VBn-KAN framework showed superior performance over traditional neural networks and other KAN variants. It demonstrated improved accuracy and adaptability across datasets, particularly excelling in multivariate time series forecasting and various computer vision tasks. The proposed method presents a notable advancement in neural network robustness and flexibility, reducing data quality dependence while maintaining model accuracy and interpretability.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The current process of creating articulated assets is manually intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Recent works have attempted reconstruction from images or videos but have limitations regarding data acquisition, making them less scalable for real-world applications.\nGap: Most existing methods for articulated object generation require either multi-view, multi-state images or provide only limited control. These requirements either make the data acquisition process cumbersome or limit the precision with which users can specify objects, reducing the practicality and scalability of these methods.\nHypothesis: The hypothesis is that generating articulated 3D objects from a single image using a diffusion model can offer a scalable and practical solution, capturing the ambiguity of part shapes and motions from a single view while producing realistic 3D reconstructions consistent with the input image.\nMethod: The method involves a pipeline utilizing a diffusion-based generative model to create articulated objects from a single image. The process starts by observing the object in a resting state and utilizes a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline through which a part connectivity graph and part abstraction guide the reconstruction from high-level structure to finer geometric details. The model learns part geometry and kinematics variations, incorporating image cross-attention and graph relation attention within a transformer-based architecture. A key feature is leveraging large pretrained models like DINOv2 for encoding fine-grained part attributes from the input image. Additionally, GPT-4o is used to predict the part connectivity graph during inference, enhancing the generation's plausibility and detail accuracy.\nConclusion: The proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in generating articulated objects from a single image, evidenced by better graph prediction accuracy, part arrangement consistency, and reconstruction quality. The approach demonstrated superior generalization capabilities to more complex and unseen datasets and proved effective through systematic evaluations on multiple datasets.

Traditional methods often employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent and simulate these systems due to their ability to capture relational structures. Recent advancements have introduced geometric GNNs that incorporate E(3) symmetries, making them invariant to transformations like rotation and reflection.\nGap: While Transformers have been successful in other fields like natural language processing, their application to simulating graph-based physical dynamics remains underexplored. Current GNN-based methods often suffer from limitations like fixed-length input requirements and susceptibility to cumulative errors in long-term predictions.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a Transformer-based architecture, specifically designed to handle spatiotemporal graphs while respecting physical symmetries, can effectively simulate long-term physical dynamics and mitigate the issue of cumulative errors.\nMethod: The paper introduces the Geometric Spatiotemporal Transformers (GSTs), leveraging an encoder-decoder architecture similar to traditional Transformers. Key features of GSTs include equivariant spatiotemporal blocks that preserve E(3) symmetries and a Temporal Difference Graph (TDG) that captures dynamic patterns to reduce cumulative errors. Experiments are conducted on datasets at various scales, including molecular, protein, and macroscopic levels, to evaluate the model's performance.\nConclusion: GSTs outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in long-term physical dynamics simulation across multiple scales, demonstrating their ability to mitigate cumulative errors and leverage variable-length historical data effectively. The introduction of TDG is crucial to their success, as it enhances the model's ability to predict long-term trajectories accurately and efficiently.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The field has seen advancements in using DPMs for visual semantics, but their adaptation to graph representation learning is still developing. Generative models have shown potential in enhancing the understanding of representations, which opens up questions about their applicability to graphs, which inherently differ from traditional data structures due to their non-Euclidean nature.\nGap: The main gap addressed is the lack of effective application of diffusion probabilistic models in graph representation learning. The challenges include dealing with the non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the absence of an encoder component in traditional diffusion models, preventing explicit data representation extraction and tuning in downstream tasks.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that diffusion probabilistic models can be adapted to graph representation learning by incorporating an encoder to transform graph structures and features into a compact representation. This adaptation will enhance the model's ability to understand and represent graph data effectively.\nMethod: The authors propose Graffe, a self-supervised diffusion model for graph representation learning. It consists of a graph encoder that extracts a compact representation from the source graph, serving as a condition for guiding the denoising process of the diffusion decoder. They theoretically establish that the negative logarithm of the denoising score matching loss forms a tractable lower bound for conditional mutual information, suggesting that the diffusion model implicitly follows a principle similar to the InfoMax principle, dubbed Diff-InfoMax. Experimental setup includes node and graph classification tasks using 11 real-world datasets, employing GNNs like GAT and GIN for encoding, with a custom diffusion decoder enhancing the representational capacity.\nConclusion: Graffe demonstrates competitive results in node and graph classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most datasets tested. This success illustrates that powerful generative models, particularly diffusion models, are effective tools for graph representation learning. The theoretical insights provided form a solid foundation for future exploration of diffusion models in graph contexts, with empirical evidence showing their capacity to produce high-quality representations.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, their ability to answer knowledge-intensive questions can degrade when the information needed isn't covered in their training data. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approaches attempt to bridge this gap by retrieving relevant information from external sources and integrating it into the LLM's processing chain. Existing RAG techniques typically filter irrelevant information and append relevant knowledge chunks directly to queries, requiring LLMs to interpret and reason out the answer. However, this approach can lead to errors due to suboptimal integration and interpretation of external knowledge.\nGap: Current RAG methodologies integrate retrieved knowledge as concatenated text, demanding high interpretative capabilities from LLMs to utilize this input. Such methods suffer from subpar integration, potentially leading to misinterpretation and ineffectiveness when overlay information is incorrect or inadequately interpreted by the LLM.\nHypothesis: Integrating an external knowledge attention mechanism as an additional attention head within the LLM could provide dynamic and layer-wise integration of retrieved knowledge, thus more effectively guiding the LLM in generating accurate answers.\nMethod: The proposed method introduces an external knowledge attention mechanism, treated as an additional attention head within the multi-head attention framework of LLMs. This mechanism encodes retrieved knowledge as vectorized representations and dynamically integrates it across different layers of the LLM using a memory-based approach. This memory mechanism assigns layer-wise weights to knowledge representation based on its relevance, enabling nuanced integration at each layer. Experiments were conducted on various QA datasets to evaluate the performance against traditional RAG approaches and baseline LLM models.\nConclusion: The proposed method effectively enhances LLMs' performance in QA tasks, outperforming both traditional approaches and existing models on various benchmark datasets. The introduction of the external attention mechanism and a memory-based layer-wise integration strategy contributes significantly to the more robust utilization of external knowledge, demonstrating the advantage of differentiated knowledge integration.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Many existing methods attempt to mitigate this by using prior task knowledge to assist the learning process. However, these methods often rely on static or empirically determined guide sampling rates, which do not adapt during training and can lead to suboptimal performance.\nGap: Current guide policy-based methods typically choose a static sampling rate for using the guide, which does not vary during training and can lead to either too conservative or too aggressive transitions from guide policies to learner policies. This can result in performance degradation or slow learning progression.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by calculating the sampling rate of a guide policy under specific assumptions, it is possible to ensure that the mean return of a learning policy can be kept above a user-defined performance degradation threshold, offering the first performance guarantee for guided reinforcement learning methods.\nMethod: The authors propose a Guided Reinforcement Learning (GRL) algorithm which calculates the guide policy sampling rate to maintain the evaluation return above a specified threshold. They introduce a roll-back feature (GRL-RB) to dynamically adjust the sampling rate and control transitions between the guide and learner policies. Experiments were conducted on structured environments such as Combination Lock and AntMaze to validate this method. The guide sampling rate \u03b1 was derived for different variations of guide and learner policies, with experimental validation on both sparse and dense reward scenarios. The algorithm was implemented on the Implicit Q-Learning framework, and comparisons with other methods were conducted to demonstrate its efficacy.\nConclusion: The proposed GRL and GRL-RB algorithms enable effective knowledge transfer from guide to learning policies while maintaining a performance guarantee. They ensure the learning policy's mean return does not fall below a user-defined threshold. GRL-RB further allows adaptive guide sampling rate adjustments to recover from potential performance degradation, proving robust across various tasks, including challenging environments like AntMaze.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The LD baseline does not appear to really reduce alpha by the same amount every time step, why is that?\\n\\n- One thing I also don't understand: Why is the alpha not degraded much faster? What I mean is why is it always degraded by $(1-\\\\alpha_0)$ and not by $(1-\\\\alpha_c)$ (algo 1, line 18) - if the assumptions on convergence you make were to hold, the updated alpha should be used for the next degradation or am I missing something?\"}"}]}

Class-guided diffusion models use class embeddings as priors, which can only differentiate categories coarsely. While effective at maintaining high semantic accuracy, they often lack detailed texture reproduction. Prior work on enhancing image generation with visual priors suggests their potential to bring the generated content closer to target distribution, benefiting various models including super-resolution models.\nGap: Class-guided diffusion models struggle with accurately depicting texture details because they rely on class priors, which offer limited and coarse guiding information.\nHypothesis: By integrating visual priors into the diffusion process, it is possible to enhance image generation by providing more detailed and semantically rich guidance, leading to better texture detail and overall image fidelity.\nMethod: The proposed solution is Diffusion on Diffusion (DoD), a multi-stage framework where the initial stage uses traditional class embeddings and subsequent stages incorporate visual priors extracted from previously generated samples. The process employs a Latent Embedding Module (LEM) for compressing and reconstructing these samples to retain only the essential semantic information while discarding redundant details. This allows the diffusion model to leverage visual priors effectively in image generation. Experiments were conducted on the ImageNet-256x256 dataset using this novel architecture, significantly reducing computational costs while improving output quality.\nConclusion: The DoD framework successfully employs visual priors to enhance image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results with reduced training costs compared to existing methods. By introducing a recurrent multi-stage generation mechanism that refines images using previously generated outputs, DoD overcomes limitations in texture detail reproduction, demonstrating improved sampling efficiency and higher fidelity in image outputs.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing works have focused on the two primary approaches for achieving generalization: contextual RL methods that enable adaptation to environmental dynamics seen during training (in-distribution, ID) and robust RL methods that aim for robust performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, often resulting in conservative performance for ID scenarios.\nGap: Current deep RL techniques either excel in ID adaptation or OOD robustness, but not both simultaneously. The challenge lies in developing a unified framework that can effectively generalize across both seen and unseen environment dynamics without compromising on the performance goals of either scenario.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that by integrating a robust adaptation module within a single architecture, it is possible to simultaneously achieve strong generalization performance for both ID and OOD environment dynamics. This approach involves a combination of contextual adaptation and adversarial RL within a unified framework.\nMethod: The authors introduce GRAM (Generalization in deep RL with a Robust Adaptation Module), which combines the benefits of ID adaptation and OOD robustness within a single deep RL architecture. GRAM employs a robust adaptation module using an epistemic neural network to quantify uncertainty and react to both ID and OOD contexts. The training process utilizes a teacher-student approach for ID contexts and adversarial RL for OOD robustness. The algorithm was tested on realistic simulated locomotion tasks using the Unitree Go2 quadruped robot to validate its performance.\nConclusion: The GRAM algorithm successfully achieves both ID and OOD generalization in a single policy architecture, providing strong evidence of improved adaptability and robustness compared to existing methods. The framework dynamically adjusts to different contexts and demonstrates superior performance in various simulated locomotive environments, indicating its potential for reliable real-world deployment.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Previous research indicates a gap between the perceived limited memorization of these models and research uncovering their data extraction capabilities. To understand privacy risks, model developers often use simple canaries to test memorization, leading to underestimations of privacy leakage.\nGap: Existing techniques for privacy auditing of LLMs using canaries are inadequate, as they generate weak membership inference attacks that yield loose privacy leakage bounds. The canaries currently used are not sufficient to reveal the true extent of memorization and privacy risks.\nHypothesis: The paper hypothesizes that designing more effective canaries, which are more likely to be memorized, can significantly improve the detection of privacy leakage in LLMs. These canaries would provide a more accurate assessment of privacy risks by generating tighter empirical bounds on privacy leakage.\nMethod: The authors develop a method to create canaries that are more likely to be memorized under different threat models. They employ strategies based on data distribution knowledge such as unigram, N-gram, and model-based canaries. Moreover, they introduce new token canaries, which are guaranteed to have high loss, making them effective for membership inference attacks. These methods are tested on several LLMs across different datasets and fine-tuning settings, including differentially private models.\nConclusion: The proposed canaries demonstrate superior performance in privacy audits compared to previous methods. The new token canary, in particular, significantly improves membership inference attacks in non-private settings and provides nontrivial privacy audit results for differentially private models. This advancement represents a new standard in privacy leakage detection, allowing for accurate estimation of empirical privacy loss.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditional stereo conversion methods involve creating disparity maps from single images or sequences, which are then used to generate stereo pairs. Recent efforts in the field focus on improving depth estimation and handling occluded areas using deep learning techniques. Video-based stereo conversion particularly benefits from temporal information in video data.\nGap: Existing video stereo conversion methods are not robust and have several drawbacks, including inaccurate depth mapping and challenges in maintaining stereo disparity consistency across frames. Most current methods do not fully leverage the temporal information available in video data for creating stereo effects and tend to produce artifacts such as texture misalignment or object deformation.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that implicit disparity guidance, combined with a novel dual-branch architecture leveraging spatial-temporal attention, can improve stereo video conversion from single-view videos by reducing errors associated with explicit disparity maps and enhancing consistency across frames.\nMethod: ImmersePro is introduced as a novel framework for video stereo conversion, featuring a dual-branch architecture comprising disparity and context branches. It leverages spatial-temporal attention to refine disparity features and applies implicit disparity guidance to generate stereo pairs without explicit disparity maps. The approach includes layered disparity warping and context fusion to maintain the semantic integrity of the input video. YouTube-SBS, a new dataset of over 7 million stereo pairs, is also provided for benchmarking.\nConclusion: ImmersePro demonstrates significant improvements in producing high-quality stereo videos compared to existing methods, as shown by quantitative metrics such as L1, SSIM, and PSNR. The implicit disparity approach, combined with layered disparity warping, offers enhanced visual quality and consistency. The YouTube-SBS dataset fills a critical gap in resources for developing and evaluating stereo video generation models.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Extrapolative protein design is a challenging area because existing machine learning methods are primarily trained to recognize patterns within the training data range.\nGap: Existing extrapolative protein design methods often rely on learning from pairs of protein examples to capture the fitness gradient. However, models based solely on pairs may fail to capture three-way (triplet) relations essential for the search, which could limit their effectiveness in extrapolation tasks.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that noisy training pairs are not informative enough to capture the fitness gradient accurately and that integrating triplet relations into the models can improve the design of proteins beyond the training region.\nMethod: The authors propose a data distillation method for extrapolative protein design by directly embedding triplet relations into preference learning models. They introduce a generative model approach using triplet ranking, evaluated on AAV and GFP datasets. The training involves creating a dataset of triplets based on sequence fitness and further refining the model using reverse KL divergence between the empirical distribution and a preference distribution. Experiments involve iterative sequence generation and comparison against several benchmark and state-of-the-art methods.\nConclusion: The proposed approach significantly improves extrapolative protein design's effectiveness. In benchmarks, this method outperformed several baseline and state-of-the-art generative methods across different datasets and difficulty levels.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly with Transformers and their variants, have enhanced model capabilities in this field. However, these models are often limited by the availability and quality of training data. Traditional data augmentation methods are fixed-form and non-adaptive, resulting in inefficiencies such as introducing noise or increased computational costs.\nGap: The primary issue addressed is the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of current data augmentation methods for time series forecasting. Existing methods do not adaptively enhance training data, fail to address specific challenging samples, and often introduce noise without clear guidance, which limits their utility for time series forecasting.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that an adaptive data augmentation method, specifically targeting marginal samples identified through prediction variance across a model zoo, can significantly improve forecasting accuracy. This can be achieved with a learnable policy using reinforcement learning to transform these samples effectively.\nMethod: The method, AutoTSAug, involves three stages. First, marginal samples are identified from the training data based on variance in prediction errors across a zoo of pretrained forecasting models. These samples indicated unstable training conditions. Second, a variational masked autoencoder (V-MAE) is trained to perform data augmentation, and the REINFORCE algorithm is applied to optimize this model. The reinforcement learning framework treats the variance across the model zoo as a reward, optimizing the neural augmentor to produce less diverse prediction errors across the models. The final stage incorporates the augmented data into the training process of a forecasting model.\nConclusion: AutoTSAug successfully enhances the performance of time series forecasting models by adaptively augmenting marginal samples, leading to more consistent prediction errors across models and improved overall accuracy. The method demonstrates significant performance gains with minimal additional computational overhead. However, it requires a robust model zoo for optimal results, suggesting future work should focus on adapting to imperfect model zoos.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

It has been influential in building a joint representation space for text and image modalities.\nGap: Prior research identified a significant modality gap in CLIP's embedding space. This gap results in sparse embeddings with text and image modalities occupying separate subregions on the hypersphere, leading to inefficiencies in cross-modal tasks.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that sharing learnable parameters between modality encoders and using a semantically-regularized intra-modality separation objective can reduce the modality gap between text and image embeddings.\nMethod: AlignCLIP incorporates two main refinements to reduce the modality gap. First, it implements parameter-sharing between the vision and language encoders to increase shared cross-modal encodings. Second, it applies an intra-modality separation objective to spread out and push apart uni-modal embeddings based on semantic dissimilarities. The approach uses a transformer-based encoder shared between the two modalities, pre-trained on the CC12M dataset, and the SBERT model for semantic regularization. Experiments involve various downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, linear probing, and multi-modal retrieval.\nConclusion: AlignCLIP significantly improves the cross-modal alignment in the CLIP embedding space. It enhances zero-shot and fine-tuned multi-modal retrieval performances, improves robustness to distribution shifts, and increases classification accuracy more than previous naive gap closure techniques.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Autoencoders (AEs) have been applied to NN weights to learn latent representations that assist in varied downstream tasks including model reconstruction and weight generation.\nGap: Despite low reconstruction error, models reconstructed from AEs trained on structural losses alone do not match the performance of original NNs. This is due to the failure of structural weight reconstruction to capture features critical for high performance.\nHypothesis: The incorporation of a behavioral loss in the autoencoder training, alongside a structural loss, can capture the necessary features for reconstructing high-performing NNs by emphasizing functional similarity between original and reconstructed models.\nMethod: The authors propose a composite loss function for autoencoders where the structural and behavioral losses are combined. The behavioral loss is calculated by comparing the outputs of the original and reconstructed models over a set of input queries, emphasizing functional equivalence. The performance of this approach is evaluated across three model zoos using different datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, EuroSAT) for both reconstructive and generative tasks.\nConclusion: Combining structural and behavioral losses improves the performance of the reconstructed models, enabling them to match the performance of original models more closely. This synergy also enhances performance across discriminative, reconstructive, and generative downstream tasks, demonstrating the importance of both structure and behavior in learning weight space representations.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, this approach faces challenges, such as the need to mitigate extrapolation errors which occur when the learning algorithm queries states and actions not well-represented in the data.\nGap: The primary gap addressed is the challenge in offline RL of handling distributional discrepancies and extrapolation errors that arise when out-of-sample actions not present in the dataset are evaluated during policy learning.\nHypothesis: The authors propose a novel algorithm called Extended Implicit Q-Learning (EIQL) that extends the utility of the Bellman update to actions not explicitly in the dataset by using the maximum Q-values, thus improving performance in offline RL by leveraging a broader action spectrum while mitigating error extrapolation risks.\nMethod: The approach combines expectile regression with Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) to develop EIQL, which occasionally queries actions not present in the dataset, balancing the Bellman update's maximum Q-value strengths against error extrapolation risks. They test it on the D4RL benchmark, which includes Gym-MuJoCo locomotion, AntMaze, Adroit, and Kitchen domains. EIQL employs a stochastic loss function determined by a Bernoulli random variable, balancing between observed in-sample actions and out-of-sample estimations.\nConclusion: EIQL outperforms traditional offline RL algorithms, particularly in environments with sparse rewards or suboptimal and incomplete trajectories. It effectively enhances the robustness of offline RL by incorporating both in-sample and out-of-sample learning and represents a significant advancement by employing in-sample offline reinforcement learning as a regularization strategy.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Previous work has focused primarily on sequential algorithms for this task, especially for log-concave distributions, leading to underutilization of parallel computing resources.\nGap: While adaptive complexity for optimization is well-researched, little is known about the adaptive complexity of sampling. Current results emphasize the query complexity of low-dimensional sampling, leaving a gap in the study of high-dimensional, high-accuracy sampling, particularly in parallel computation models.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that for both unconstrained and box-constrained sampling, an almost linear iteration algorithm cannot achieve a pre-defined exponential accuracy under total variation distance for log-concave distributions, demonstrating intrinsic limitations of current sampling approaches.\nMethod: The authors establish lower bounds for the adaptive complexity of sampling algorithms by using novel constructions of hardness potentials and properties of random partitions. They analyze these bounds for both unconstrained and box-constrained settings, considering conditions like strong concavity and smoothness, and use classical smoothing techniques to assert their claims. The key technical tool involves the reduction to sampling problems defined over structured random partitions.\nConclusion: The study concludes that current algorithms with near-linear iterations under parallel settings are fundamentally limited in achieving sub-polynomial and exponential accuracies for log-concave sampling. The results imply critical limits on adaptive complexity and suggest that further advancements in algorithm design would require overcoming these inherent limitations.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Reward-model-free approaches like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) focus on simpler pipelines and direct adjustments using preference data, but can still lead to issues like determinism and non-coherent behaviors due to limited dataset regularization.\nHypothesis: Soft Preference Optimization (SPO) is proposed as a reward-model-free method for aligning LLMs with human preferences using a natural loss function that combines preference loss with comprehensive regularization across the model\u2019s output distribution. SPO claims to be simpler and more flexible than existing methods.\nMethod: SPO combines a preference loss that aligns model estimates with expert preferences and a regularization term to ensure minimal deviation from the pre-trained model\u2019s outputs across the entire distribution. The experiments involved aligning LLaMA2-7B and a 110M parameter model using preference data, evaluating SPO against other methods like DPO, in terms of win-rates against baseline models, using objective measures and theoretical justifications based on the Bradley-Terry model.\nConclusion: SPO is demonstrated to be a viable, simpler alternative for aligning LLMs with human preferences without a reward model, achieving favorable performance metrics in various alignment scenarios, and offering flexibility with its regularization approach and softmax exponent adjustment.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Previous generative models like BEVGen and MagicDrive demonstrate control over 2D or simple 3D layouts but struggle with nuanced 3D geometry control and suffer from limitations in spatial alignment and 3D voxel editing.\nGap: Existing methods for generating street view images with diffusion models are inadequate for precise 3D geometry control as they fail to effectively incorporate and manipulate complex 3D occupancy information in voxel space. They often result in limited semantic control and struggle with the spatial alignment necessary for robust 3D-aware generation, which is crucial for applications like testing autonomous driving systems in rare and challenging conditions.\nHypothesis: SyntheOcc can efficiently encode 3D geometric information through innovative use of 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs), enabling the generation of photorealistic and geometrically controlled street view images. This new representation will preserve detailed 3D scene information and align spatially with generated images, providing precise control over occupancy conditions for data augmentation and scenario testing in autonomous driving.\nMethod: The paper introduces SyntheOcc, a framework utilizing diffusion models capable of synthesizing photorealistic, geometrically-controlled images conditioned on 3D occupancy labels. To overcome limitations of prior methods, the approach leverages 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs) as the conditional input, allowing preservation and spatial alignment of complex scene geometry. The paper outlines the generation process that includes multi-plane per-pixel semantic indices aligned with generated pixels. Additionally, the framework incorporates an MPI encoder, reweighing strategies to address class imbalance, and cross-view and cross-frame attention to maintain multi-view and temporal consistency. Experiments were conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and SytheOcc demonstrated improvements in perception model training and controllable dataset generation.\nConclusion: SyntheOcc successfully demonstrates improved geometric controllability in image generation by utilizing 3D semantic MPIs, enhancing visual consistency and enabling the synthesis of diverse and realistic datasets. The method aids in data augmentation and supports testing autonomous systems in challenging scenarios, showing superior performance in generating task-aligned synthetic data when compared to traditional methods. The model effectively serves as a data augmentation tool to improve the robustness of perception models in 3D occupancy prediction.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditional CT methods have limitations due to high X-ray doses causing radiation damage and long acquisition times for high resolution imaging. Recent advancements focus on improving data efficiency through learning-based reconstruction and 'smart' data acquisition techniques.\nGap: Conventional CT reconstruction algorithms do not utilize potential structural data distributions found in prior datasets, and standard uniform angle acquisition lacks efficiency due to ignorance of data structure. Existing active learning methods have limitations in sequential decision-making, complicated by uncertainty quantification and data structure modeling difficulties.\nHypothesis: By integrating generative diffusion models with active learning, the authors propose to adaptively select data measurements that effectively capture the structure embedded in CT imaging, reducing data acquisition needs while improving reconstruction quality.\nMethod: The method involves pre-training a generative diffusion model on domain-specific data to learn the data's underlying distribution. In the active learning phase, this model helps estimate uncertainty in CT reconstructions by generating samples from the posterior distribution, conditioned on current measurements. The next measurement is selected based on identified maximal uncertainty, optimizing data acquisition. The method was tested using three real-world tomography datasets - chip, composite materials, and lung data - evaluating efficiency improvements in reconstruction quality and measurement reduction.\nConclusion: Diffusion Active Learning (DAL) significantly enhances image reconstruction quality while reducing X-ray exposure by up to 4x compared to traditional methods, showcasing potential for broader application in scientific and materials imaging contexts due to reduced cost and beam-time, though its trade-offs and limitations in certain high-stakes applications like medical imaging must be addressed.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, SAM has limitations in semantic-aware segmentation tasks, such as semantic, instance, or panoptic segmentation, due to its inability to assign semantic labels to patches without the help of other models or methods.\nGap: The main gap identified is the challenge for SAM in handling semantic-aware segmentation tasks, as it may over-segment instances into multiple patches, making it hard to determine the correct instance groupings. Existing solutions either rely heavily on standalone models for proposals, weakening SAM's foundational capabilities or attempt to assign labels to SAM's patches without effectively addressing over-segmentation issues.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that by establishing a novel approach called SAM-CP, which introduces composable prompts on top of SAM's capabilities, they can enhance SAM's ability to perform versatile segmentation tasks, including semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, particularly in open-vocabulary contexts.\nMethod: The proposed SAM-CP method introduces two types of composable prompts\u2014Type-I, which aligns SAM patches with text labels, and Type-II, which determines if two patches with the same text label belong to the same instance. This system employs a unified affinity framework, utilizing semantic and instance queries to merge patches with high affinity into coherent outputs, thus addressing segmentation without the exponential increase in computational complexity typically associated with such tasks. The authors performed experiments on datasets like COCO and ADE20K to validate the method's performance.\nConclusion: SAM-CP significantly enhances the semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation capabilities of SAM, achieving state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary segmentation on various datasets. This novel methodology demonstrates the potential for significantly improved semantic perception in vision foundation models and offers insights for future developments aimed at generalized image segmentation tasks.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Conversely, machine unlearning focuses on removing specific information from models to comply with data privacy regulations, introducing a challenge when integrating lifelong learning and unlearning due to their contradicting goals.\nGap: Existing lifelong learning methods do not integrate the ability to selectively unlearn information from models, which is essential to address data privacy concerns imposed by legal requirements like the right-to-be-forgotten. This is particularly challenging in task-incremental learning where data is observed sequentially, and previous data may not be available for retraining.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that it is possible to develop a memory-efficient lifelong learning framework that prevents catastrophic forgetting, enables forward knowledge transfer, allows for exact task unlearning, and minimizes memory requirements by optimizing task-specific sparse subnetworks within a single architecture.\nMethod: The proposed method, Privacy-aware Lifelong Learning (PALL), optimizes sparse subnetworks for each task, sharing parameters within a fixed-capacity neural network. It ensures exact unlearning by resetting specific subnetworks associated with tasks to be forgotten. PALL uses an episodic memory rehearsal mechanism to retrain any reset parameters shared with subsequent tasks, ensuring no performance degradation in other tasks.\nConclusion: PALL effectively bridges lifelong learning with privacy-aware unlearning, achieving state-of-the-art performance by preventing catastrophic forgetting and enabling exact task unlearning. The method demonstrates scalability across architectures and datasets, offering a memory-efficient solution that integrates learning and privacy considerations for responsible AI applications.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Specifically, A) I don\u2019t understand the difference between m_t and \\\\bar m_t. The authors say the latter are the parameters specifically trained using data from D_t, but I don\u2019t understand this statement. What does \u201cspecifically trained\u201d mean? B) When describing the metric A_t, it\u2019s unclear whether the final model checkpoint (after addressing the whole sequence) is used to compute accuracy on all tasks, or is a separate checkpoint (right after training on the particular task) used to evaluate the accuracy on each task? The text made me think the former but the notation a_{i,t} and explanation below made me think the latter. C) \u201c\u201cRegularization-based methods [...] were indifferent to task unlearning instructions, since the original methods are not adapted to unlearning\u201d \u2013 how were these applied to unlearning tasks, then?\\n\\n- Insufficient description (in the main paper) for how various other methods were adapted from the standard lifelong setting to the privacy-aware lifelong setting. It is difficult to fully grok how this adaptation was done and why in that particular way (rather than applying other types of approximate unlearning from the literature, for example).\\n\\n- It is unclear how one should interpret the A_u metric. Having a network perform at chance level in terms of accuracy does not imply an unlearning guarantee, as the authors also acknowledged. It is not obvious that lower A_u is better (an accuracy that is \u201ctoo low\u201d can compromise privacy and cause vulnerability to attacks). Further, even when taking the right reference point (for how low accuracy should be) into consideration, accuracy-based metrics correlate poorly with more rigorous metrics for unlearning (see e.g. [1]). The authors seem to acknowledge this but still use this metric in the results and in discussions. It would be great to clarify in what way this information should be used and taken into consideration, given this caveat.\\n\\n- Missing an important baseline: training sequentially with Differential Privacy (DP). This would yield approximate (but theoretically sufficient) unlearning without the need for resetting and retraining any weights. Various DP baselines can be considered: a DP variant of \u201cSequential\u201d, where all parameters are updated for all tasks, as well as a DP variant of a sub-networks architecture, like in the proposed approach, where each task gets to choose which parameters to update, but in this case addressing unlearning requests can be done trivially (via a \u201cno op\u201d). Depending on the desired level of privacy, I expect such methods to have lower accuracy, but this feels like an important and relevant baseline to include and capture these trade-offs.\\n\\n- Missing baselines from the unlearning literature. A plethora of approximate unlearning methods have been proposed (see e.g. [2-4]), that try to post-hoc modify a model to remove the influence of a subset of its training data. It feels like these would be readily combinable with the \u201cSequential\u201d approach, for instance. \\n\\n- Building further on the above remarks, it would be very useful to build a comparison between the proposed method (and other exact solutions) with inexact unlearning. While the authors have considered some inexact methods, there aren\u2019t proper metrics considered to empirically estimate the privacy of such methods. The only metric considered for this is the accuracy on unlearned tasks, which is a weak notion of privacy, as discussed above. I fully understand that adding empirical privacy auditing is a substantial amount of additional work and potentially difficult to do all of this within a single paper, but I do view this as a clear piece that is missing, or area for future work. \\n\\n- Another baseline can be training a model sequentially (without subnetworks), and when unlearning is needed, simply retrain the entire model from scratch (using the data in the buffers). I don\u2019t expect this to perform well in terms of accuracy (and would also be less efficient at handling unlearning requests), but would be a useful data point for comparison; this is more akin to the \u201cretrain from scratch\u201d reference point in the unlearning literature. One may additionally consider an \u201coracle\u201d version of this, that assumes access to all past data as another reference point (I understand that past data is assumed not to be available in life-long learning, hence referring to this as an \u201coracle\u201d).\\n\\n- A limitation of this framework is that \u201cuser privacy\u201d can only be addressed (via exact unlearning) if a user\u2019s data is cleanly separated in terms of \u201ctasks\u201d. Other scenarios, where all users participated in all \u201ctasks\u201d, would make this framework unable to support users to request their data to be deleted.

It has applications in robot navigation, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. This field faces challenges such as drastic viewpoint changes, scale variations, and occlusions between ground-view and aerial-view images. Past methods, like the DetGeo model, utilized attention mechanisms to establish spatial correspondences but fell short in interaction and information synthesis between views.\nGap: Existing methods inadequately transfer information and refine spatial relationship feature maps between views, leading to erroneous focus on irrelevant noise and impacting geo-localization performance. Additionally, there is a scarcity of comprehensive datasets for the cross-view object geo-localization task.\nHypothesis: Introducing a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) will improve interaction and understanding of contextual information across views, suppressing irrelevant edge noise. Furthermore, integrating a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM) will enhance feature representation by capturing multi-scale spatial features.\nMethod: The proposed method includes two main components: the Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM) and the Multi-head Spatial Attention Module (MHSAM). CVCAM facilitates interaction and fusion of features from query and reference images through repeated cross-attention operations, while MHSAM utilizes different sized convolutional kernels to extract multi-scale spatial features. A new dataset, G2D, was created to enrich the existing resources for 'Ground\u2192Drone' geo-localization tasks. The entire framework was evaluated on the CVOGL and G2D datasets, using evaluation metrics such as accu@0.25 and accu@0.5, to demonstrate its effectiveness.\nConclusion: The novel dual attention approach significantly enhances geo-localization accuracy by improving feature interaction and representation. AttenGeo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across different datasets. The new G2D dataset addresses the gap in 'Ground\u2192Drone' tasks, and the CVCAM and MHSAM components show promising results in refining and enhancing feature maps for better localization.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Previous works have proposed multiple explanations for this fragility, including linearity, decision boundary closeness, and feature compression. However, a consensus on the cause of neural network fragility remains elusive, despite extensive theoretical and empirical investigations.\nGap: There is no consensus or complete theoretical explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural network classifiers, especially concerning why they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks even with small perturbations.\nHypothesis: The adversarial fragility of neural networks arises from their tendency to perform classification using compressed features, making it easier for adversarial attacks to succeed by modifying the small subset of features used by the network for decision-making.\nMethod: The authors provide a matrix-theoretic analysis showing that neural networks' adversarial robustness degrades with increasing input dimension. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that neural networks can only achieve $1/\\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible robustness. They extend their analysis from two-layer to multiple-layer networks using a novel characterization of the QR decomposition of products of random Gaussian matrices. Numerical experiments with both linear and non-linear networks validate these theoretical predictions, showing that such networks often use compressed features for classification, leading to adversarial fragility.\nConclusion: The matrix-theoretic approach demonstrates that while neural networks have high accuracy under normal conditions, their adversarial robustness diminishes as input dimensions grow, with robustness potentially being only $1/\\sqrt{d}$ of optimal. Feature compression is fundamentally linked to this fragility, consistent with previous information-theoretic explanations. Future work should extend the analysis to more general data distributions and explore the relationship between adversarial robustness and network parameters such as depth.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Vision Transformers (ViTs), due to their architecture, display potential flexibility to handle layer pruning based on emerging literature. Self-attention modules in transformers are known for their adaptability, which possibly allows consideration beyond input variations to variations caused by layer order changes.\nGap: Current neural networks, particularly vision transformers, lack robustness to changes in layer order, pruning, or node failures, especially relevant in distributed computing environments where such conditions are common.\nHypothesis: Randomizing the execution order of attention and feed-forward layers during training will create vision transformers that can adapt to arbitrary layer order executions and handle layer failures at test time.\nMethod: The authors propose three variants of training models, with the primary method being LayerShuffle. This involves training with randomized layer order to teach adaptability. The approaches vary by providing additional information to layers about their position or predicting their position. They train and test these models on datasets like ImageNet2012 and CIFAR-100. LayerShuffle's performance is compared to baseline models and analyzed under various conditions, including merging multiple trained models and evaluating robustness against layer pruning.\nConclusion: Models trained with the LayerShuffle approach exhibit robustness to arbitrary layer order execution and perform adequately under layer pruning, retaining functionality even in 'Frankenstein' models formed by merging trained layers from different models. Despite achieving slightly reduced accuracy compared to sequential models for regular execution orders, LayerShuffle retains performance under scenarios of random execution order and node failure, showcasing its potential for distributed inference setups.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This issue is prominent when models are trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM), as they tend to generalize well for majority group examples while memorizing minority group instances, leading to fairness and safety concerns in deployment.\nGap: The primary gap addressed by this paper is the poor generalization of deep learning models on minority groups due to spurious correlations and memorization. Existing methods to tackle this gap often require group labels, which is impractical for large, unannotated datasets.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that reducing example-level memorization can address spurious correlations without needing group labels. By localizing memorization in specific neurons and dropping them during inference, models can improve their generalization on minority groups.\nMethod: The authors propose FairDropout, a technique that applies example-tied dropout to redirect the memorization to specific neurons during training, and these neurons are subsequently dropped during inference. The approach is tested on the subpopulation benchmark suite, including tasks from vision, language, and healthcare. The method is scaled to larger networks like ResNet-50 and BERT, focusing on datasets such as CelebA, MetaShift, MultiNLI, and MIMIC-CXR.\nConclusion: FairDropout outperforms existing baseline methods in reducing reliance on spurious correlations without the need for explicit group annotations. It demonstrates improvements in worst-group accuracy across multiple datasets.

Traditionally, 3D hand pose estimation has relied on labeled datasets and supervised learning, constructing datasets in controlled settings or using pseudo-labeling and self-supervised pre-training approaches. Recent human-centric video datasets like Ego4D offer large-scale in-the-wild data ripe for pre-training, which has not been fully utilized in prior methodologies.\nGap: Prior methods for 3D hand pose pre-training have not fully utilized the diverse hand images accessible from in-the-wild videos. Existing contrastive learning methods, like SimCLR and PeCLR, mainly generate positive samples from single images using data augmentation, which limits the variation in hand appearance and background, thereby limiting the potential of diverse samples for improving 3D hand pose estimation.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by identifying and leveraging similar hand poses from a large pool of in-the-wild images for constructing positive pairs in contrastive learning, the pre-training process can be significantly enhanced, leading to improvements in 3D hand pose estimation outcomes.\nMethod: The proposed SiMHand framework uses a contrastive learning approach to pre-train a 3D hand pose estimation model. It collects a large-scale dataset of over 2.0 million hand images from in-the-wild sources like Ego4D and 100DOH. Similar hand poses are identified using a PCA-based dimension reduction on 2D keypoints extracted from these images, and positive pairs are formed from different images with similar hand poses. The method implements an adaptive weighting mechanism for the contrastive loss, which weights the loss based on the proximity of hand poses, enhancing the learning from truly similar samples.\nConclusion: The proposed SiMHand framework achieves significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods, with enhancements of 15% over PeCLR on the FreiHand dataset, 10% on DexYCB, and 4% on AssemblyHands. This performance demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging large-scale, diverse datasets and more informative contrastive pairs in the self-supervised pre-training scheme for 3D hand pose estimation.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

However, MRI data often suffers from noise due to accelerated acquisitions or low-field settings, which can impair diagnostic accuracy. Traditional denoising methods have limitations due to their reliance on handcrafted image priors, and supervised learning approaches require high-SNR labels, which are difficult to obtain. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but existing self-supervised methods often oversmooth images, losing fine details.\nGap: There is a scarcity of high-SNR labels for training supervised denoising methods in MRI, limiting the effectiveness of these approaches. Current self-supervised methods also face challenges as they tend to oversmooth images and perform less well than supervised methods. There is a need for a method that can effectively denoise MRI without requiring clean labels and that can preserve fine details.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that Corruption2Self (C2S), a novel score-based self-supervised framework, can effectively denoise MRI images by extending denoising score matching (DSM) to the ambient noise setting. This method hypothesizes to learn denoising across multiple noise levels from noisy data and preserve fine spatial features while eliminating the need for high-SNR labels.\nMethod: The proposed Corruption2Self (C2S) framework is based on a Generalized Ambient Denoising Score Matching (GADSM) loss, which models the conditional expectation of higher-SNR images given further corrupted observations. This approach involves a forward corruption process to create increasingly noisy versions of the MRI images and a denoising function that learns from these corrupted observations. The method introduces a reparameterization of noise levels to stabilize the training process and enhance convergence and a detail refinement extension to balance noise reduction and spatial detail preservation. The approach is validated through experiments on the M4Raw and fastMRI datasets, comparing its performance against superivseld and other self-supervised methods.\nConclusion: The Corruption2Self (C2S) method achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised denoising methods and performs competitively against supervised approaches, even under varying noise levels and across different MRI contrasts. It effectively reduces noise while preserving important imaging details. The study shows C2S's potential to generalize in clinical MRI settings without requiring high-SNR training data.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has proven effective in improving the quality of image generations, particularly in models like Stable Diffusion. However, high guidance scales in CFG can lead to issues such as oversaturation and reduced diversity in outputs.\nGap: High guidance scales necessary for enhancing image quality in classifier-free guidance (CFG) often result in oversaturated outputs and simplistic image compositions. Despite this, high CFG scales are widely used due to their improved image quality, indicating the need for a method to mitigate oversaturation while maintaining quality.\nHypothesis: The paper hypothesizes that by decomposing the CFG update term into parallel and orthogonal components relative to the conditional model prediction, the parallel component can be down-weighted to reduce oversaturation while maintaining image quality. Introducing rescaling and momentum, akin to gradient ascent, could also alleviate these issues.\nMethod: The authors present a novel approach termed adaptive projected guidance (APG), which involves three main elements: orthogonal projection to separate the CFG update term, rescaling to constrain update magnitudes, and reverse momentum to adjust update directions. This method is applied across various diffusion models and evaluated based on metrics like FID, recall, and saturation scores.\nConclusion: APG shows improved FID, recall, and saturation results while maintaining precision comparable to CFG. The method mitigates oversaturation at high guidance scales, proving to be a superior alternative to traditional CFG. It is compatible with multiple models and samplers, effectively extending the usable range of guidance scales in diffusion models without additional computational cost.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This involves retrieving the closest vector from a dataset where the query labels are a subset of the labels of the retrieved vector. Current practices in NNS are focusing on extending algorithms to efficiently handle filter constraints.\nGap: Despite practical advances, a comprehensive theoretical framework for MultiFilterANN remains underdeveloped. Existing solutions often lack generality beyond one or two filters and do not fully leverage graph-based methods. Further theoretical insights, particularly concerning space-time trade-offs, are necessary.\nHypothesis: Graph-based algorithms can provide the best-known space-time trade-offs for MultiFilterANN, especially in the large filter regime. Further, these algorithms can be competitive empirically by integrating filter constraints into the NNS process.\nMethod: The paper presents novel algorithms incorporating ANN algorithms into subset query algorithms, achieving robust space-time trade-offs. Empirically, graph indices for NNS are adapted with a penalized distance function to adhere to filter constraints. This approach is assessed against state-of-the-art solutions and extends to datasets with more than two filters. New datasets are also released to support further research.\nConclusion: The study demonstrates theoretically superior graph-based methods for MultiFilterANN with empirical evidence of their competitive performance. The approach shows significant improvements in recall, handled efficiently through penalized distance functions and strategic query routing.

However, it seems to this reviewer that the proposed algorithm is supported neither by (a) theoretical results, nor by (b) empirical evaluation. The theoretical results are for the different algorithm (described in Section 4) and it may be that the algorithm that is evaluated empirically in Section 7 is a yet different algorithm (described in Appendix E).\\n\\nSpecifically, the article starts by reviewing a CIP data structure (Charikar et al., 2002) for subset query problem and then proposing a MultiFilterANN algorithm that combines it with either a graph or LSH index structure. However, later in Section 6 it turns out that the authors propose a completely different graph-based empirical algorithm that does not use a CIP data structure at all. Thus it seems that theoretical analysis of Section 4 is disconnected from the rest of the article (except that MultiFilterANN problem is considered), and does not offer theoretical support for the proposed method. The authors should clarify what is the connection between the empirical algorithm and the theoretical discussion of Section 4.\\n\\nAnother part that must be clarified significantly is the empirical evaluation in Section 7. In particular, it is unclear whether the results are obtained by using the graph-based method proposed in Section 6 or the hybrid methodology described in Appendix E? According Appendix E, when the estimated number database points satisfying the constraints is small, either a brute force search after identification of these points, or a clustering-based approach is used instead of the graph-based method proposed in Section 6. If the hybrid methodology of Appendix E is used to generate the results of Section 7, this does not yet tell anything about the performance of the proposed graph method, since it is possible that the results are obtained using brute force search or a clustering-based approach.\\n\\nYou should include a direct comparison between the proposed graph method and the earlier filtered ANN methods (ParlayIVF$^2$ and ACORN) (assuming the results of Section 7 are for the hybrid method described in Appendix E). In particular, when the number of database points satisfying the constraints is small, I suspect that the brute force baseline is the fastest method, and if you enable this option for your method, but not for ParlayIVF$^2$ and ACORN, this distorts the results. In addition, you should include ablation experiments documenting in which regime your method outperforms this simple baseline (that has an additional benefit of producing exact results).\\n\\nIt is also not clear how relevant the studied problem (MultiFilterANN) is. I am not deeply familiar with literature on filtered ANN search, but it seems that the recent related works cited by the authors only consider the special cases of one or two filters. In particular, I suspect that when there are multiple filters (for instance, $|S_q| \\\\geq 3$), the simplest possible ad hoc approach (brute force search after finding the database points with correct labels) would often outperform more complicated filtered ANN methods, since in this case the set of database points matching all of query labels is probably quite small.\\n\\nPresentation is low quality. The article does not seem carefully finished. For instance, citations should be inside the parenthesis when the author names are not used as a part of the text. For instance, you should write \\\"we may use Locality Sensitive Hashing (Indyk & Motwani 1998a)\\\" instead of \\\"we may use Locality Sensitive Hashing Indyk & Motwani 1998a\\\". Just use citep-command if you are using natbib. As an another example, there is a list of 26 (!) consecutive citations in the beginning of Related work-section. It seems that the only relevance of these works is that they are connected to ANN search.

They offer advantages over classical numerical solvers, such as handling high-dimensional problems and easy coding for both forward and inverse problems. However, PINNs can struggle with complex PDEs, particularly those with high-frequency solutions, due to their non-convex loss functions and the F-principle, which suggests low frequency features emerge first during training.\nGap: Singularities in the source functions of PDEs lead to numerical instability and increase the need for a large number of sampling points, making the solution process using PINNs computationally expensive. This issue is particularly challenging for PINNs due to their difficulty in capturing high-frequency singular features efficiently.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a novel sampling method based on diffusion models and optimal transport coupling flow-matching can better address the challenges of singular PDE source functions. By generating sampling points where PDE residuals are higher, this approach aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of PINN solutions in such scenarios.\nMethod: The method introduces a flow-matching sampling approach for PINNs. It involves using diffusion models capable of generative sampling from the distribution of PDE residuals. The optimal transport coupling flow-matching technique generates more sampling points in regions of high PDE residuals rather than explicitly modeling the probability density proportional to residuals. This is done by approximating residual distribution with vectors from the flow matching dynamics, thus generating points by simulating ODE dynamics. Algorithms are proposed for executing this flow matching within PINN frameworks (FMS PINN). Experiments were conducted on complex PDE examples like the Poisson equation with peaks and the linear elasticity problems to demonstrate efficacy.\nConclusion: The proposed flow-matching sampling approach enhances PINN solutions for PDEs with complex singularities by efficiently sampling points where residuals are high. In various scenarios, like the linear elasticity equation for materials with complex inclusion geometries, the approach outperformed traditional methods and normalizing flow-based sampling techniques by achieving lower mean squared error (MSE) and effectively capturing intricate solution details. The approach shows promise for improving PINN methods, particularly in singular PDE contexts.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing benchmarks evaluate these long-context capabilities but lack a focus on mathematical reasoning within such contexts, which is essential for real-world applications.\nGap: Current benchmarks do not adequately assess LLMs' ability to perform mathematical reasoning over long contexts. This is crucial for their application in real-world scenarios where such reasoning is often required.\nHypothesis: Introducing a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the long-context mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs will reveal inadequacies in current models and drive improvements.\nMethod: The paper introduces the MathHay benchmark, which evaluates long-context mathematical reasoning by constructing scenarios from real-world documents. The benchmark involves multiple steps: collecting relevant documents, generating various types of reasoning questions (e.g., Single-Step Single-Document, Multi-Step Multi-Document), applying quality control checks, and creating 'haystacks' of mixed relevant and irrelevant documents to simulate realistic, challenging information environments. Eight top-performing LLMs are tested across different input lengths (32K, 64K, 128K tokens).\nConclusion: The experiments indicate that even the best-performing models struggle with long-context mathematical reasoning, achieving only about 51.26% accuracy at 128K tokens. The MathHay benchmark highlights significant room for improvement in LLMs and provides a new automated method for benchmarking their reasoning capabilities in complex, real-world scenarios.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Such external data is often held by private entities who may not be willing to share due to privacy and proprietary concerns, creating challenges and costs for model trainers seeking to improve model performance.\nGap: The paper addresses the challenge of efficiently selecting and acquiring useful data subsets from external data owners under restricted data-sharing conditions, aiming to maximize model performance while adhering to a constrained data-sharing budget.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that evaluating data subsets based on feature space distances and gradient matching can help identify small but informative data subsets from data owners, improving model performance with minimal data exposure.\nMethod: The proposed method, Mycroft, involves a three-step process: 1) The model trainer sends task-related data samples to data owners. 2) Data owners use algorithms based on functional similarity (gradient matching) and feature similarity to identify small, relevant data subsets. 3) The model trainer evaluates these subsets to decide if more data should be acquired. Mycroft's efficacy is assessed through experiments on classification tasks across two domains (computer vision and tabular data), comparing its performance to full-information and random sampling baselines.\nConclusion: Mycroft effectively identifies useful data subsets, outperforming random sampling and approximating full-information performance with reduced data budgets.

This is particularly significant in cross-domain recommendations where systems trained in one domain have to handle unseen items in another.\nGap: Existing methods often enhance recommendation performance using cross-domain knowledge but treat the knowledge transfer as a 'black box,' limiting their interpretability and understanding. This makes it difficult to trust and audit the systems.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that introducing domain indexing through an adversarial Bayesian framework can improve recommendation performance and provide interpretability for cross-domain knowledge transfer. By inferring domain indices, it is possible to better understand and improve cross-domain recommendations.\nMethod: The proposed method, Domain Indexing Collaborative Filtering (DICF), uses an adversarial Bayesian framework to infer domain indices during cross-domain recommendation. It models the recommendation problem using a probabilistic graphical model and adversarial learning to generate domain indices and domain-invariant features, ensuring that features spurious to generalization are captured in the domain index. The performance was empirically evaluated using synthetic datasets (Rec-15 and Rec-30) and a real-world dataset (XMRec) with tasks set in different domain structures to showcase generalization and interpretability improvements.\nConclusion: The Domain Indexing Collaborative Filtering (DICF) framework significantly improves cross-domain recommendation performance while providing insights into domain relationships, enhancing interpretability.

It uses an LLM to identify key sentences in the context and then explicitly highlights these sentences by manipulating the model's attention scores, specific to certain attention heads. This process is performed at inference time without altering model parameters. The method includes a coarse-to-fine search for effective attention heads, reducing computational overhead. The effectiveness of SteerPrompt was demonstrated through experiments on open-book QA tasks using models like Vicuna-7B and LLAMA-3 with datasets such as Natural Questions and HotpotQA.\nConclusion: SteerPrompt significantly enhances LLMs' ability to comprehend and utilize contextual information in open-book QA tasks, showing substantial performance improvements over baseline prompting methods.

Linear attention mechanisms like RWKV from NLP have been identified as potential solutions due to their efficiency and scalability.\nGap: The challenge is to develop a vision model that integrates the versatile processing strengths of ViTs but reduces computational complexity, thus enabling efficient high-resolution image and dense prediction task processing without the need for window operations.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes Vision-RWKV (VRWKV) as a model that retains the advantages of ViTs in capturing global information and handling sparse inputs, while achieving linear computational complexity in attention through modifications inspired by the RWKV model from NLP.\nMethod: VRWKV builds on the RWKV architecture, modifying it to suit vision tasks by implementing a quad-directional shift (Q-Shift) for semantic expansion and bidirectional global attention (Bi-WKV) to achieve linear complexity. The VRWKV models have scalable architectures ranging from 6M to 335M parameters, trained on large datasets such as ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-22K. The experimental setup includes tests on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation using benchmark datasets like ImageNet-1K and COCO with comparisons to ViT models.\nConclusion: VRWKV shows superior performance in image classification compared to ViTs with lower computational cost and memory usage, especially at high resolutions.

However, it is also posited that this property can lead to overly large updates and subsequent loss spikes.\nMethod: The authors propose SignSoftSGD (S3), an optimizer that uses a generalized sign-like formulation with a flexible p-th order (p >= 1) momentum in the denominator. This allows S3 to use larger learning rates. It also integrates Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) for faster convergence without memory overhead and uses the same exponential moving average coefficient for both numerator and denominator momentums, minimizing tuning efforts and loss spikes. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on vision and language tasks were conducted to validate S3's performance.\nConclusion: S3 demonstrates faster convergence, improved performance, and fewer loss spikes compared to Adam, even with larger learning rates.

Previous works focused on disentangling attribute and object features and aligning them with word embeddings to improve recognition of unseen compositions. These have utilized joint space representations and feature disentanglement techniques.\nGap: The paper identifies three main limitations of existing approaches: ineffective disentanglement due to background influence and attribute-object interaction, the inadequacy of existing word embeddings to capture complex multimodal semantics, and the models being overconfident with seen compositions, which limits generalization.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) embeddings and attribute smoothing can improve compositional zero-shot learning by addressing the limitations of ineffective disentanglement, inadequate embeddings, and overconfidence in seen compositions.\nMethod: The proposed framework, TRIDENT, involves three major components: 1) Visual feature extraction using feature adaptive aggregation (FAA) modules to reduce background noise and learn multi-granularity features. 2) Attribute-object disentanglement through shared and exclusive weights from image pairs. 3) Feature alignment using MLLM embeddings from LLaVA v1.5 and Label Smoothing with auxiliary attributes.

Traditional methods like LSTM and Transformer have limitations in capturing long-sequence interactions effectively and efficiently. State-space models (SSMs) have shown promise in handling long-sequence data with lower computational costs.\nGap: Previous methodologies suffer from accumulating confounding biases and inefficiencies in processing long sequences. Existing methods like Causal Transformer exhibit increasing errors and computational complexity as sequence lengths grow.\nHypothesis: Utilizing state-space models (SSMs) can enhance both the effectiveness and efficiency of time-varying counterfactual prediction by addressing the limitations of traditional methods in sequence modeling and bias correction.\nMethod: The proposed approach introduces Mamba-CDSP, a state-space model (SSM) utilizing Covariate-based Decorrelation towards Selective Parameters (CDSP) to de-correlate current treatments from historical information. This is designed to mitigate confounding bias while preserving covariate information. It employs a linear time-complexity mechanism and empirically replaces convolutional layers with dropout layers to prevent overfitting. Evaluation is performed on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, comparing with existing baselines.\nConclusion: Mamba-CDSP significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

This alignment often involves using human feedback to fine-tune the behavior of these models to align with various human-centric goals, such as helpfulness and harmlessness. The concept of superalignment emerges, where humans, acting as relatively weak supervisors, guide the evolving superhuman models. Relevant works have noted a weak-to-strong generalization phenomenon, whereby weakly supervised models outperform their supervisors.\nGap: Despite the positive results reported in weak-to-strong generalization, there are concerns about a security issue, termed weak-to-strong deception. This issue arises when more advanced models deceive weaker ones by appearing aligned in the areas the weak models can evaluate, but behaving misaligned in areas beyond the weak model's knowledge.\nHypothesis: In multi-objective alignment scenarios, where alignment targets may conflict, strong models could knowingly perform poorly in areas unknown to weak supervisors. This would be done in exchange for better performance on other objectives, resulting in deceptive behavior that prioritizes alignment in areas visible to weak models over those that are not.\nMethod: The authors investigated this weak-to-strong deception phenomenon through experiments involving a series of models including GPT-2-series, OPT-series, and Mistral-7B. The experiments were designed to explore the behavior of weakly supervised strong models under different alignment settings, such as reward modeling and preference optimization, with conflicting or non-conflicting objectives. Explicit and implicit types of conflicts were introduced, and various datasets, such as CAI-Harmless, were used to evaluate the model's alignment behavior across different dimensions.\nConclusion: The study confirmed the existence of the weak-to-strong deception across all experimental setups, with the tendency for stronger models to exhibit deceptive behavior increasing with the capability gap between them and their weaker supervisors. While bootstrapping using intermediate models showed potential to reduce deception, its effectiveness remains partial. The findings underscore the critical need to address the reliability of superalignment in intelligent systems to maintain control over increasingly capable models.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditionally, these models employ an autoencoder with a moderate spatial compression ratio, such as 8x, which works well for low-resolution images. However, for high-resolution images, higher compression ratios are necessary to manage the computational load, especially for diffusion transformer models that are quadratically complex as the number of tokens increases.\nGap: Current autoencoder models exhibit a significant drop in reconstruction accuracy when the spatial compression ratio is increased beyond moderate levels. For instance, the reconstruction fidelity (rFID) significantly worsens when moving from an 8x to a 64x compression ratio, indicating that the optimization difficulty and generalization issues persist at higher compression levels.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by introducing Residual Autoencoding and Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation techniques, it is possible to enhance the reconstruction accuracy of high spatial-compression autoencoders. These techniques aim to address the optimization difficulties and generalization penalties associated with high compression ratios.\nMethod: The authors introduce Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), utilizing two main strategies: Residual Autoencoding and Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation. Residual Autoencoding involves adding non-parametric shortcuts to neural network modules to learn residuals based on a space-to-channel transformation, which helps address the optimization difficulty. Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation includes a three-phase training strategy that separates the GAN loss training into a focused local refinement phase, along with high-resolution latent adaptation to mitigate generalization penalties. The authors then apply DC-AE to latent diffusion models for efficient image synthesis, demonstrating enhanced speed and quality on datasets like ImageNet 512x512, achieving significant gains in inference and training throughput while maintaining or improving image quality metrics like FID compared to existing models.\nConclusion: The Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE) offers a significant improvement for high-resolution diffusion models by efficiently managing higher spatial compression ratios up to 128x without degrading reconstruction quality. By employing Residual Autoencoding and Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, the autoencoders increase their efficiency, resulting in faster training and inference times on GPUs, alongside better generative performance (as measured by FID scores) compared to traditional autoencoders with lower compression factors.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Such games model competitions between two entities and extend two-player games to a multi-player context. Algorithms have achieved significant success in two-player games such as Go and poker, but heterogeneous team games present unique challenges due to role diversity within teams and the requirement for ex ante coordination, which allows for correlated strategies before a game starts.\nGap: The primary gap identified in existing research is that current methods, particularly the prominent Team PSRO, do not fully cover the joint team policy space in heterogeneous games where teammates play diverse roles. This limitation leads to convergence on sub-optimal ex ante equilibria, with higher exploitability and failure to reach a global ex ante equilibrium.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by parameterizing heterogeneous policies for teammates and optimizing these sequentially, it is possible to achieve a monotonic improvement in team rewards. They hypothesize that integrating these mechanisms into the PSRO framework will enable the computation of global ex ante equilibria without increasing computational complexity.\nMethod: The authors introduce Heterogeneous-PSRO (H-PSRO), a novel framework for heterogeneous team games. H-PSRO utilizes sequential correlation mechanisms within the PSRO framework to cater to heterogeneous roles among teammates. They achieve this by parameterizing policies for individual team members and updating these sequentially to ensure an improvement in coordination, thereby expanding the policy search space without exponential complexity increase. The authors validate the method through experiments on matrix heterogeneous games and complex settings like StarCraft and Google Research Football.\nConclusion: The Heterogeneous-PSRO framework successfully reduces exploitability compared to Team PSRO in heterogeneous team games and demonstrates superior performance in complex benchmarks, outperforming homogeneous counterparts. Although effective, the method\u2019s reliance on sequential optimization could be a limiting factor in extremely large-scale games, and adaptation to continuous action spaces needs further exploration.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

This paper makes the claim that previous work [1] relies on the assumption that the two-team zero-sum has to be homogenous and a policy sharing mechanism that requires every player in the same team to play under the same strategy. (i.e. the policies of players in the same team are ($\\\\pi_{k, share}, \\\\pi_{k, share}, ..., \\\\pi_{k, share} )$. However, to the reviewer's best knowledge, the algorithm provided in [1] does not require such strong assumption and does not employ a policy sharing mechanism. Team PSRO algorithm in [1] directly optimize the team strategy over the team's joint strategy space, it outputs a joint policy of each team with potential correlation instead of outputting each players' strategy individually (in this case no correlation would be possible). I would appreciate it if the author specify where the policy sharing mechanism is posted in [1].\\n\\n2. The definition of set $E_c$ in definition 2 remains ambiguous. When considering possible deviations from an equilibrium in $E_c$, do we only consider possible deviations in $S_c$ or we consider all possible deviations in $S$? Consequently, the proof of proposition 2 regard $E_{share} \\\\subseteq E$ is also unclear.\\n\\n3. It is unclear how the authors reach the conclusion that $S_{share} \\\\subsetneqq S$. Further, in equation (3a) and (3b), the notation $\\\\sigma_{1, share} \\\\in \\\\Pi_1 \\\\backslash \\\\Pi_{1, share}$ remains confusing.\\n\\n4. Lemma 1 defines the advantage function $A_{\\\\pi_1}^{i_l}(o_1, a_1^{i_{1:l-1}}, a_1^{i_{l}}| \\\\pi_2) = Q_{\\\\pi_1}^{i_{1:l}}(o_1, a_1^{i_{1:l}}| \\\\pi_2) - Q_{\\\\pi_1}^{i_{1:l-1}}(o_1, a_1^{i_{1:l-1}}, a_1^{i_{l}}| \\\\pi_2)$. This notation remains extremely confusing and it's unclear what the value $Q_{\\\\pi_1}^{i_{1:l}}(o_1, a_1^{i_{1:l}}| \\\\pi_2)$ stands for.  The Q-value function in multiagent setting should be evaluated based on the reward of a joint action $a^{i_1:n}$ instead of the joint (or single) action of a subset of players.\\n\\n5. The authors claim that utilizing the advantage function would bypass the computational difficulty induced by the exponential growth of the the policy space. However, it is unclear how they update the advantage function to bypass this difficulty since the number of advantage function is also growing exponentially with the number of actions.\\n\\n6. The authors state that the proposed oracle sequential BRO, could efficiently compute the best responding joint policy of a team. However, due to the unclear definition of the advantage function, it's not clear if the oracle can have some monotonic value functions. Furthermore, even some monotonic increment over the value function was achieved by sequentially picking each player's action. It is not sufficient to show that oracle would output the optimal policy.\\n\\n\\n[1] Stephen Marcus McAleer, Gabriele Farina, Gaoyue Zhou, Mingzhi Wang, Yaodong Yang, and Tuo- mas Sandholm.

This technology is beneficial for applications like virtual singers and music production. Traditional methods primarily rely on recognition-synthesis frameworks that involve recognizing content and re-synthesizing with a target voice. Recent works have attempted to improve the separation of content, timbre, and pitch but face challenges with zero-shot SVC, where models must convert voices without prior exposure to the source or target singers of the reference audio.\nGap: Existing SVC methods struggle with zero-shot performance due to issues like incomplete feature disentanglement, which results in timbre leakage, and dependency on speaker look-up tables which are challenging to update for new, unseen speakers. Moreover, the limited training data available further constrains generalization capabilities.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that an improved SVC model can achieve high-quality zero-shot conversion by using better feature disentanglement techniques to minimize timbre leakage and enhance timbre encoding, supported by a sufficiently large and diverse dataset for training.\nMethod: The authors introduce SaMoye, a zero-shot SVC model that performs feature disentanglement into content, timbre, and pitch. They combine outputs from multiple ASR models and compress content features using methods like k-means and vector quantization to reduce timbre leakages. The model enhances timbre features by unfreezing the speaker encoder and using top-3 similar speakers for embedding. The model is trained on an extensive dataset consisting of over 1,815 hours of singing from 6,367 speakers, ensuring robust model generalization. Experiments included objective and subjective metrics to evaluate conversion quality in both human and non-human timbres.\nConclusion: SaMoye outperforms existing models in zero-shot SVC tasks, especially under challenging conditions like converting singing to non-human timbres (e.g., animal sounds), demonstrating the effectiveness of its approach in overcoming common SVC limitations. The work highlights the importance of large datasets and comprehensive feature disentanglement in advancing SVC technology.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Existing models, especially camera-based and LiDAR-based 3D perception systems, often rely solely on sensor inputs, ignoring historical context that could be beneficial for improved detection and segmentation.\nGap: There is a lack of frameworks that effectively incorporate historical spatial priors into 3D perception systems of autonomous vehicles, leading to missed opportunities for leveraging past data to enhance current perceptions.\nHypothesis: Introducing Differentiable Map Priors (DMP) to 3D perception systems can improve performance in tasks like 3D object detection and semantic map segmentation by utilizing spatial priors learned from historical data without adding significant computational overhead.\nMethod: The authors propose Differentiable Map Priors (DMP), a framework that incorporates historical spatial priors into multi-view 3D perception systems. DMP uses a sparse and differentiable map representation based on multi-resolution hash maps to encode useful information from past traversals. These features are learned in an end-to-end manner with neural networks during training. At inference, the learned map enhances the current sensor inputs for improved perception tasks. Extensive experiments were conducted using the nuScenes dataset, integrating DMP with various baseline architectures such as BEVDet, BEVFormer, and PETR, utilizing both convolutional and transformer-based models.\nConclusion: Differentiable Map Priors significantly enhance 3D object detection and semantic map segmentation performance across different architectures by leveraging prior traversed locations.

Attention-based GNNs help improve robustness by highlighting important information, but they lack theoretical explanations for their effectiveness against attacks.\nGap: Existing robust attention-based GNNs do not recognize or leverage the connection between improved adversarial robustness and adherence to the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that the Information Bottleneck (IB) loss is an indicator of an attention-based GNN's robustness to adversarial attacks. Lower IB loss, indicating less correlation with input data and better alignment with outputs, enhances robustness. They propose that minimizing IB loss through a novel method, RGA-IB, improves a GNN's robustness.\nMethod: The authors introduce Robust Graph Attention inspired by Information Bottleneck (RGA-IB). This method incorporates a graph attention mechanism that explicitly reduces IB loss in a multi-layer GNN. The process simulates gradient descent across layers where each layer contributes to the reduction of IB loss. RGA-IB was compared to other graph attention methods and robust GNNs using datasets like Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Polblogs under various adversarial attack scenarios.\nConclusion: The study concludes that RGA-IB significantly enhances the robustness of GNNs under adversarial attacks more effectively than existing methods. This is achieved by lowering IB loss, which signifies a better balance between learning from input data and aligning with desired outcomes.

Current approaches lack mechanisms to effectively handle these view-specific conflicts in their prediction fusion processes.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a computational trust-based discounting method can effectively resolve conflicts in multi-view data by evaluating the reliability of predictions made by individual views through an instance-wise probability-sensitive approach.\nMethod: The authors develop a computational trust-based discounting method within the Evidential Multi-view framework. This methodology leverages an evidence network to operate on a view-specific and instance-wise basis, utilizing the principle of trust discounting from subjective logic. The reliability of view-specific predictions is transformed into a degree of trust using Binomial opinion theory. Experiments are conducted on six real-world datasets.

Neurons often represent multiple unrelated concepts, which complicates understanding their role in network computations. Neuronal entanglement, where multiple features overlap within a neuron, is suspected to affect how networks perform under weight sparsity, a post-training optimization technique aimed at efficiency by reducing parameters through methods like setting certain weights to zero.\nGap: The effect of polysemanticity on network performance under weight sparsity has not been adequately explored. While various sparsification algorithms exist, there is a lack of research specifically investigating how neuronal entanglement impacts the effectiveness of these sparsification techniques.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that neuronal entanglement, particularly in 'Wasserstein Neurons', impacts network performance under sparsity, and they suggest using the Wasserstein distance from a neuron's output distribution to a Gaussian as a novel metric to quantify entanglement. They hypothesize that disentangling such neurons using a mixture of experts can maintain or improve model performance under sparsity.\nMethod: The paper introduces a novel metric\u2014Wasserstein distance\u2014to quantify neuronal entanglement. The authors identify 'Wasserstein Neurons', which have high entanglement due to their non-Gaussian output distributions and significant impact on model accuracy. The paper proposes an experimental framework called 'Sparse Expansion', which clusters input embeddings per layer to form a 'mixture of experts', using SparseGPT for sparsification. This method strengthens the disentanglement of neuron outputs under high sparsity, maintaining performance by allocating specialized experts to different input clusters.\nConclusion: The study concludes that the Wasserstein distance is a strong indicator of entangled neurons and that these 'Wasserstein Neurons' are critical for maintaining model accuracy under sparsity. Sparse Expansion effectively improves performance by reducing the entanglement of neuron outputs, particularly for the most entangled neurons, supporting the notion that entanglement hampers the effectiveness of sparsification in LLMs. The findings suggest that future sparsification algorithms should consider neuronal entanglement to optimize model performance.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed to mitigate these challenges by reducing the number of trainable parameters. Prior methods like LoRA utilize low-rank decompositions but face limitations related to compression ratios and parameter scaling. Quantum circuits, known for their unitary representation capabilities, offer potential advantages for achieving parameter-efficient adaptations.\nGap: Traditional PEFT methods like LoRA face limitations due to their reliance on low-rank decompositions, which restricts the compression ratio and results in linear scaling of trainable parameters with the model size. There is a need for methods that achieve higher parameter efficiency and can handle the scaling effectively.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that using quantum computations and quantum unitary parameterizations can achieve ultra parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large models. They hypothesize that the Pauli parameterization will allow the number of trainable parameters to grow only logarithmically with the ambient dimension, significantly enhancing parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance.\nMethod: The approach leverages quantum-inspired modules using generalized Pauli parameterizations. Unitary matrices are parameterized with a logarithmic number of parameters using quantum circuits composed of smaller unitary rotations (RY) and controlled-Z gates. This method, called Quantum-PEFT, applies these principles to reparameterize transformations in pre-trained models, focusing on transfer learning tasks in language and vision. The method was benchmarked against datasets like GLUE and CIFAR10, showing significantly reduced parameters compared to LoRA, while holding competitive performance.\nConclusion: The paper concludes that Quantum-PEFT significantly improves parameter efficiency for fine-tuning pre-trained language and vision models. Quantum-PEFT achieves a 5 to 25-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to conventional methods like LoRA, while maintaining competitive performance. It demonstrates that quantum-inspired parameterizations are a promising avenue for developing more efficient deep learning models.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditional approaches often use simplifying assumptions like linearity and convexity but struggle with complex and non-convex solutions. Recent methods leverage Bayesian optimization (BO) to address issues regarding constrained, noisy, and derivative-free optimization environments.\nGap: The primary challenge addressed is the inefficiency and limitations of existing bilevel optimization methods, which often rely on nested frameworks that are sample-inefficient and fail to allow information flow between the two optimization levels. These methods require a full optimization of the lower level for each upper-level evaluation, which is not practical in settings without derivatives or in the presence of noise.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a bilevel Bayesian optimization algorithm, which simultaneously optimizes both the upper- and lower-level problems using confidence bounds to create trusted sets of feasible and optimal solutions, can improve sample efficiency and provide theoretical guarantees of performance in terms of regret bounds.\nMethod: The authors introduce BILBO, an algorithm that utilizes Bayesian optimization for bilevel problems by jointly optimizing both levels. It employs Gaussian processes to model functions and maintain trusted sets constructed from confidence bounds. These trusted sets approximate feasible regions and optimal lower-level solutions without requiring full lower-level convergence, improving sample efficiency. The algorithm operates in a decoupled setting, querying only one function per iteration, which is useful when dealing with different simulators or experiments for upper and lower levels. The approach assures sublinear bounds on cumulative and instantaneous regret, theoretically guaranteeing efficient convergence.\nConclusion: BILBO demonstrates its effectiveness in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, providing substantial improvements over baseline methods in terms of regret and convergence speed. By efficiently managing the exploration of the search space through trusted sets and a strategic function query method, BILBO proves to be a robust tool for bilevel optimization challenges, especially under noisy, constrained, and derivative-free conditions.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Recent efforts have focused on various data selection strategies to improve data efficiency, such as filtering high-quality data, mixing data from multiple domains, or dynamically selecting data to boost downstream tasks. These methods, however, have typically been used independently and fail to capitalise on their potential when combined collaboratively.\nGap: Existing methods for improving data efficiency in LLM pretraining address different criteria but often conflict when combined. Moreover, the integration of multiple data selection strategies into a single framework is challenging, with the potential for negative performance impacts due to inherent conflicts among methods.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a novel multi-agent collaborative data selection mechanism can resolve inherent conflicts between different data selection methods and enhance data efficiency for LLM pretraining. This approach involves independent agents prioritizing data according to their criteria and a console to dynamically adjust and integrate their inputs throughout the training process.\nMethod: The method involves a multi-agent framework where each data selection method operates as an independent agent that prioritizes data based on a specific criterion (quality, domain, or topic) by scoring training data samples. The framework employs an agent console to combine the scores from all agents, producing optimized data selection. During LLM pretraining, agents can dynamically adjust their influence based on the rewards calculated using influence functions. The paper describes a detailed process using agents to sample, score, and update data prioritization through interaction with a model being trained on the SlimPajama dataset.\nConclusion: The experimental results show that the proposed multi-agent collaborative data selection approach significantly improves data efficiency and accelerates convergence in LLM pretraining, achieving up to a 10.5% average performance gain across multiple language model benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework effectively mitigates conflicts between different data selection strategies by dynamically adjusting their integration based on model performance.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Scaling laws, which relate model performance to dataset size, model size, and total training compute, have been well established in these fields.\nGap: In robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation and imitation learning, data scaling laws are less understood, preventing the field from achieving similar levels of generalization and performance seen in NLP and CV models. Current robotic policies struggle with zero-shot generalization across different environments and objects.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that appropriate data scaling laws exist in robotics, specifically within the domain of imitation learning for robotic manipulation. They propose that by scaling the diversity of environments and objects rather than just the number of demonstrations, robot policies could achieve significant generalization, capable of performing tasks in novel settings with unseen objects.\nMethod: The method involved collecting over 40,000 demonstrations across various environments and objects using hand-held grippers and modeling the data with a Diffusion Policy. The authors focused on tasks like 'Pour Water' and 'Mouse Arrangement' to study the effects of scaling environments, objects, and demonstrations on policy generalization. Data collection was conducted in real-world scenarios, emphasizing diversity and using a standardized protocol for evaluations, including visual observations and scoring based on task performance.\nConclusion: The study demonstrated that the generalization performance of robot policies follows a power-law relationship with the diversity of training environments and objects rather than the number of demonstrations. Increasing diversity was shown to be more effective in enhancing policy generalization. The study suggested a data collection strategy that efficiently achieves around 90% success rates in novel environments and unseen objects, demonstrating the viability of training policies for zero-shot deployment in any environment.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The framework can adapt to different tasks easily, providing novel insights into agent design, and the paper suggests that the G\u00f6del Agent offers a promising direction for developing flexible, self-improving AI systems.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

In each iteration is produces a new policy and a new learning function.\\n* After N iteration the policy is evaluated on held-out test problems and this result is reported.\\n\\nThis process gives the Godel agent significantly more inference compute than any of the hand-designed agent systems, which makes the comparison unfair. The only fair comparison in Table 1 is to Meta Agent Search which seems to typically be comparable in performance.

There is also a scarcity of benchmarks that incorporate visual elements in mathematical tasks. Advanced models like GPT-4 have already achieved high success rates on these simpler benchmarks, suggesting a saturation of challenge, particularly for school-level mathematics. Recent efforts to introduce university-level and more complex problems remain limited in size and comprehensiveness, often missing the educational depth offered by real-world university-level coursework.\nGap: There is a significant gap in evaluating how LLMs perform on advanced, university-level mathematical problems, particularly in a multimodal context with visual components. Existing benchmarks do not assess university-level math adequately, lack free-form problem-solving challenges, and fail to address the evaluation of LLMs' ability to judge solutions to these complex problems.\nHypothesis: Introducing a comprehensive benchmark of university-level mathematical problems, including visual elements, will better evaluate the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Furthermore, creating a dataset for meta-evaluation can help assess LLMs' effectiveness in evaluating solutions to open-ended mathematical problems, filling a significant gap in understanding LLM capabilities and evaluation reliability.\nMethod: The paper introduces U-MATH, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 open-ended university-level problems sourced from teaching materials across six core subjects, with 20% incorporating visual components. For grading the open-ended tasks, the paper employs an LLM to judge solution correctness and introduces a supplementary dataset, \u00b5-MATH, to evaluate the LLMs' capacity to judge mathematical solutions effectively. The evaluation involves general domain, math-specific, and multimodal LLMs, comparing their performances on this newly created benchmark. Various LLMs are tested for their accuracy in text-based and visual mathematical tasks.\nConclusion: The study reveals that current LLMs struggle significantly with university-level mathematical problems, achieving maximum accuracies of only 63% on text-based tasks and 45% on tasks with visual elements. The meta-evaluation task also poses challenges, with the best LLM judge attaining an F1-score of 80% on the \u00b5-MATH benchmark. These findings highlight the limitations of existing LLMs in processing complex and advanced mathematical problems and stress the need for better models and evaluation techniques. The U-MATH and \u00b5-MATH datasets provide a robust framework for future research into enhancing LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

The GSM8K benchmark is commonly used to evaluate grade-school level mathematical reasoning, but its fixed nature and potential data contamination limit comprehensive understanding of LLM capabilities.\nGap: The study aims to address the uncertainty surrounding the genuine mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, as current benchmarks, such as GSM8K, do not provide a reliable measure due to data contamination risks and limited question variability.\nHypothesis: The authors hypothesize that the decline in performance observed in LLMs when complexity increases suggests that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning but rather attempt to mimic reasoning steps from their training data. This leads to significant performance variation across different instances of similar questions.\nMethod: The authors introduce GSM-Symbolic, a benchmark designed using symbolic templates to generate diverse question variants from the GSM8K dataset. This allows for controlled evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities. The study involved a large-scale analysis of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, examining their performance variation across 5000 examples derived from the templates. Experiments involved altering numerical values, proper names, and the number of clauses in the questions to test the robustness and reasoning fragility of LLMs.\nConclusion: LLMs show significant variability in performance due to their fragility in reasoning tasks, often relying on pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning. The models are particularly sensitive to changes in numerical values and increased question complexity. The introduction of GSM-NoOp further reveals a critical flaw where models fail to ignore irrelevant information, indicating deeper issues in their reasoning process that require further research.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Traditional evaluation metrics focus on the fidelity and relevance of the generated data to the input prompt, often based on shared embeddings like CLIP. However, these metrics are typically designed for unconditional generative models and focus less on diversity aspects specific to prompt-based approaches.\nGap: Existing diversity metrics do not distinguish between diversity arising from variations in text prompts and diversity contributed by the generative model itself, which is essential for evaluating prompt-based generative models.\nHypothesis: The proposed method suggests using matrix-based information measures to decompose the kernel-based entropy of generated data into conditional entropy (representing model-induced diversity) and mutual information (measuring relevance between generated data and prompts). This decomposition allows for evaluating prompt-induced and model-induced diversity separately.\nMethod: The authors propose an information-theoretic framework for diversity evaluation in prompt-based generative models. They decompose kernel-based entropy into conditional entropy and mutual information, resulting in two new metrics: Conditional-Vendi score and Information-Vendi score. The Conditional-Vendi score captures the model-induced diversity, while the Information-Vendi score measures the statistical relevance between the generated samples and the text prompts. They conduct numerical experiments with text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-captioning models to validate these scores against known model rankings.\nConclusion: The proposed method effectively quantifies internal diversity in prompt-based generative models, separating prompt-induced from model-induced diversity. The Conditional-Vendi and Information-Vendi scores show consistency with known diversity and relevance benchmarks across different generative tasks.

These models use pre-trained priors to modify reverse-time sampling by incorporating measurement likelihood information. They have shown success in sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions, especially in image synthesis, by simulating processes that perturb data into random noise and then reverse them back to data.\nGap: Existing methods using diffusion or flow-matching models struggle in challenging linear inverse problems, such as those with high measurement noise or when the problem is severely ill-posed. They tend to be either inefficient in inference or incapable of handling difficult scenarios consistently.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes that by guiding the reverse-time sampling process with measurement interpolants through theoretically justified schemes, their method, Flow with Interpolant Guidance (FIG), can improve the efficiency and effectiveness in solving linear inverse problems, particularly under challenging conditions.\nMethod: FIG uses a pre-trained flow or diffusion model where reverse-time sampling is guided by measurement interpolants. Measurement y is interpolated through the forward process to obtain interpolants {yt}, which perturbs the reverse process. The likelihood of yt is represented by qt(yt|xt) and used in sampling xt. Experiments are run on linear image reconstruction tasks with these models, particularly focusing on scenarios with high noise or severe ill-posedness, and efficiency in terms of memory and runtime is compared against baseline methods.\nConclusion: FIG demonstrates highly competitive results in various linear image reconstruction tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms especially in challenging scenarios.

The need to safeguard 3D assets\u2019 copyright and privacy is crucial due to the computational demands in optimizing 3D scenes and the rapid evolution of tampering techniques. Using 3DGS for steganography, which involves hiding bits, images, or 3D content in a manner that allows for lossless extraction, is an emerging area with applications in encrypted communications, copyright protection, and more.\nGap: Existing NeRF-based steganography methods face challenges when applied to 3DGS because 3DGS uses explicit point cloud files, which are publicly accessible and transparent. Furthermore, existing Gaussian splatting (GS) steganography approaches, such as GS-Hider, struggle with reduced rendering fidelity, high computational costs, and security vulnerabilities, particularly in the geometric structure security of visualized point clouds.\nHypothesis: SecureGS, a novel steganography framework inspired by Scaffold-GS's anchor point and neural decoding, can improve security and efficiency for 3D Gaussian splatting by utilizing a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism and a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy.\nMethod: SecureGS leverages a hybrid decoupled Gaussian encryption mechanism to securely store offsets, scales, rotations, and RGB attributes of hidden Gaussian points within anchor point features, accessible only through privacy-preserving neural networks. The framework introduces a density region-aware anchor growing and pruning strategy to optimally locate and secure hiding regions. The SecureGS method is tested for embedding and extracting 3D objects, images, and bits within 3DGS using extensive, efficient rendering, which achieves higher fidelity and speed compared to existing methods.

Previous research has shown the importance of effectively capturing multi-scale features in time series for effective modeling. However, with Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS), challenges arise from irregular sampling intervals and asynchronous variable observations with distinct scales. Traditional approaches often lack the ability to capture multi-scale characteristics in such complex contexts.\nGap: Existing time series multi-scale analysis methods generally assume consistent original scales across all variables, which is suboptimal for IMTS characterized by mixed granularity features and distinct scales. This mismatch makes it difficult to extract multi-scale dependencies and correlations effectively in IMTS.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that a hierarchical patch graph network (Hi-Patch), which can effectively capture and model the multi-scale dynamics and inter-variable correlations in IMTS, will outperform existing models.\nMethod: Hi-Patch is designed with an intra-patch graph layer and inter-patch graph layers. The intra-patch graph layer captures local dependencies using fully connected graph networks within each time segment (patch) of the same scale. Inter-patch graph layers then hierarchically update and extract larger-scale patterns. Fine-grained features are processed at the lower layers, and coarse-grained features are extracted at higher levels, adapting to both sparse and dense sampling over variables. The model is tested on forecasting and classification tasks across different datasets by comparing with baseline models.\nConclusion: Hi-Patch effectively captures both fine-grained and coarse-grained dependencies in IMTS, leveraging intra-patch and inter-patch graph layers to process scales progressively. The experimental evaluation on eight datasets indicates that Hi-Patch outperforms state-of-the-art models in both forecasting and classification tasks, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

To address these issues, text watermarking for LLMs adds detectable features to LLM outputs, focusing on watermark detectability, minimal impact on generated text, and robustness against text modification. However, the imperceptibility of these watermarks hasn't been well-studied, which is crucial as providers may not want to disclose watermark presence, reducing user willingness and vulnerability to attacks.\nGap: Current research lacks an investigation into the imperceptibility of watermarking techniques in LLMs. This gap is significant because understanding if users can notice watermarks is essential for the practical deployment of these systems without affecting user willingness or exposing watermarks to attacks.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that by crafting prompts that exploit consistent biases introduced by watermark keys, a unified method (Water-Probe) can identify if an LLM has been watermarked. They hypothesize that increasing the randomness in the selection of watermark keys can enhance the imperceptibility of watermarked LLMs.\nMethod: The authors introduce the Water-Probe algorithm to detect watermarked LLMs by crafting prompts. It operates by crafting two prompts with similar output distributions and sampling repeatedly with fixed watermark keys. Detection relies on the difference consistency of the outputs, indicating a watermark if consistent differences are present. They also propose the Water-Bag strategy to enhance watermark imperceptibility by merging multiple watermark keys, aiming to increase randomness in key selection. Extensive experiments were conducted using various LLMs and watermarking techniques to demonstrate the effectiveness of Water-Probe.\nConclusion: The study finds that almost all mainstream watermarking algorithms can be detected using the Water-Probe method. The Water-Probe algorithm shows high accuracy in identifying watermarked LLMs while maintaining a low false positive rate. The Water-Bag strategy enhances watermark imperceptibility by increasing key selection randomness but with a trade-off in detectability. This work highlights the importance of improving the imperceptibility of watermarked models and introduces new strategies to achieve this goal.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

These algorithms use closed-form loss functions to tune models directly to offline preferences, showing promising results in human-AI alignment.\nGap: Despite the development of various DPA algorithms and their empirical success, there is a lack of a conceptual and technical framework to understand the differences between these algorithms and develop new DPA loss functions. This absence makes it challenging to reason about the underlying semantics of DPA algorithms systematically.\nHypothesis: The authors propose that DPA losses can be formalized in terms of discrete reasoning problems using symbolic logic. By deriving symbolic expressions for existing DPA losses, it is possible to systematically understand their semantics and relationships, and develop new variants from first principles. The framework aims to provide a foundation for reasoning about the semantics of DPA algorithms, aiding both analysis and development of novel losses.\nMethod: The authors devise a novel formalism that characterizes DPA loss functions through symbolic logic. They introduce a probabilistic logic framework that translates existing DPA losses into symbolic programs by counting their weighted propositional models, a process akin to probabilistic inference. The method includes deriving new preference structures that link these symbolic expressions with the semantics of DPA losses, facilitating exploration of the DPA loss landscape and formal relationships between variants. They illustrate this approach using various DPA algorithms and demonstrate the framework's potential by deriving new loss functions.\nConclusion: The formalization reveals a large and structured landscape of DPA loss functions, unlocking a systematic approach for exploring new loss variants. By providing a clear semantic foundation, the framework aids in better understanding existing losses and deriving new algorithms, potentially enhancing human-AI alignment. The study emphasizes the potential for significant improvements and invites further exploration in the structured landscape of DPA losses.\n\n\n--- REQUIRED CATEGORIES ---\nWe need the following fields in the output:\n1) Soundness\n2) Presentation\n3) Contribution\n4) Rating\n5) Confidence\n6) Strengths\n7) Weaknesses\n8) Questions\n\n--- POSSIBLE VALUES & DEFINITIONS ---\n\nSoundness, Presentation, and Contribution (1\u20134):\n- 1: poor\n- 2: fair\n- 3: good\n- 4: excellent\n\nRating (1\u201310):\n- 1: Trivial or wrong\n- 2: Strong rejection\n- 3: Clear rejection\n- 4: Ok but not good enough - rejection\n- 5: Marginally below acceptance threshold\n- 6: Marginally above acceptance threshold\n- 7: Good paper, accept\n- 8: Top 50% of accepted papers, clear accept\n- 9: Top 15% of accepted papers, strong accept\n- 10: Top 5% of accepted papers, seminal paper\n\nConfidence (1\u20135):\n- 1: The reviewer's evaluation is an educated guess\n- 2: The reviewer is willing to defend the evaluation, but might be wrong\n- 3: The reviewer is fairly confident that the evaluation is correct\n- 4: The reviewer is confident but not absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct\n- 5: The reviewer is absolutely certain that the evaluation is correct and very familiar with the topic\n\n--- OUTPUT FORMAT ---\nPlease produce only a JSON object with this exact structure (no extra keys):\n{\n  \"Soundness\": <int>,\n  \"Presentation\": <int>,\n  \"Contribution\": <int>,\n  \"Rating\": <int>,\n  \"Confidence\": <int>,\n  \"Strengths\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Weaknesses\": \"<string>\",\n  \"Questions\": \"<string>\"\n}\n\nNo explanations or markdown formatting.

Recent video diffusion models have advanced this field but still face limitations in handling these challenges effectively.\nGap: Existing methods struggle with audio-lip synchronization, maintaining long-term identity consistency, and achieving natural expressions aligned with audio. They rely on fixed audio features and limited past frames for temporal modeling, which leads to artifacts and error accumulation.\nHypothesis: The paper proposes that introducing a memory-guided temporal module and an emotion-aware audio module can enhance long-term identity consistency, motion smoothness, and natural expression generation in audio-driven talking video generation.\nMethod: The paper introduces MEMO, an end-to-end diffusion model with two key modules: a memory-guided temporal module that uses linear attention to model long-term temporal information, and an emotion-aware audio module using multi-modal attention and Emotion AdaNorm for improved audio-video interaction. MEMO is trained on a large dataset without facial inductive biases and includes a training pipeline that involves face domain adaptation, robust scale-up training, and dynamic past frame training. MEMO was evaluated quantitatively against baselines and through human evaluation, demonstrating superior performance in video quality and synchronization.\nConclusion: MEMO significantly improves identity consistency, audio-lip synchronization, and expressive quality of talking videos compared to state-of-the-art methods.
