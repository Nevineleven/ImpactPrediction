Overall, the paper presents a novel and promising approach to handling label noise in graph neural networks based on probabilistic graphical model.\n\n2. The sequentially introduced models PRGNN-V1 and PRGNN-V2 are clearly depicted and the proposed objectives are well motivated. \n\n3. Experiments are conducted on both noisy Homophilous and Heterophilous graphs. Clear improvements are observed compared to the implemented methods.", "Weaknesses": "1. Several crucial points remain unclear. First, it is still hard to understand why we need the uncertainty modeling. One might directly apply the encoder-decoder models equipped with the corresponding losses to handle the noisy labels. To be specific, what happens if we only use Q and P_\\varphi without the prior distribution, and conduct the training without the prior-related losses? The second question is related. From the experiments in Figure 3, the weighted cross-entropy loss wL_CE(P_\\varphi, Y_N) is much more important than others. So, it seems it is much more important to balance the loss between reconstruction of clean labels and that of noisy labels, other than the probabilistic modelling particularly given the label space (which is the random variable we focus on) is of small dimension. Third, the authors claim that the proposed probabilistic graphical model is able to avoid the issue of label smoothness in existing methods. However, it seems this is attributed to the application of prototype label vectors, instead of simple concatenation of labels with node embeddings for message passing. This is also observed in Figure 3. Overall, to make the proposed models effective, the authors introduce various techniques. However, it appears that the one which demonstrates consistent success is not aligned with the contributions claimed by the authors. \n\n2. About the introduction of the baselines, it is unknown which one applies label smoothness, and which one is proposed for Heterophilous graphs.\n\n3. It seems this paper is only applicable for the transductive setting not inductive setting. \n\n4. The last question is on the general research domain for learning from noisy graphs. While it is true that many data we process in practice definitely contain different kinds of noise, the proposed methods are always evaluated in the scenarios where we add artificial perturbation to the clean data. My point is we actually need some real tasks and perhaps some fixed benchmarks to evaluate the performance of different methods, such that we can clearly justify how the progress is made and how the challenges are addressed.", "Questions": "See the weaknesses above."}}
